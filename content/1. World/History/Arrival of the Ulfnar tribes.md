The [[Ulfheonar]] tribes migrated from the north. On their way they raided and pillaged. 

At the start the raids where smaller, but over time they grew in size and small warbands turned into great war-hosts.

After their most prominent warlord [[Ulfheonar]] where defeated in battle and buried close to [[Ulfmyr Fen]] in a burial mount formed as a snake.

The remainder of the tribes, now without leadership, settled in the [[#Mountains-to-the-south]] to the south.
