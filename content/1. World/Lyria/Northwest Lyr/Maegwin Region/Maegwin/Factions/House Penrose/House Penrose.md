- **Expand Influence Subtly**: They work to manipulate politics from the shadows, influencing events without revealing their hand.
- **Monopolize Magical Resources**: The Penrose lands contain rare herbs and minerals used in magic, which they guard jealously and trade only with trusted allies.
- **Maintain Isolation**: Despite their influence, they prefer to remain distant from public affairs, interacting with other factions only when it benefits their long-term plans.

## History
House Penrose has ancient roots, claiming descent from druids and sorcerers of old who once ruled the northern forests. Over time, they have accumulated immense knowledge of both arcane and political matters, using it to subtly extend their influence across the region. They are known to conduct mysterious rituals and protect ancient places of power, making them feared and respected by others.

They often provide discreet arcane services to those in power, including enchanted items, potions, or magical protection, in exchange for favors and loyalty.

## Relationships with Other Factions

Their motto, **“In Shadows, Strength”**, reflects their belief that true power lies in subtlety, knowledge, and the unseen forces of the world.
