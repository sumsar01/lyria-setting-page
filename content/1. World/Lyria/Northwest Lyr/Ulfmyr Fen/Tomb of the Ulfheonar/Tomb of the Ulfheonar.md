# `=this.file.name`
The tomb of the savage warlord known as the Ulfheonar is buried beneath an enormous earthen mound cast in the shape of a serpent. Found west of [[Ulfmyr Village]], the mysterious mound is given a wide berth by most hunters and woodsmen, who regard it either as haunted or home to the King of Elfland. 

Adventurers attempting to recruit hirelings to aid in the exploration of the tomb will need to pay wages in gold, not silver.
