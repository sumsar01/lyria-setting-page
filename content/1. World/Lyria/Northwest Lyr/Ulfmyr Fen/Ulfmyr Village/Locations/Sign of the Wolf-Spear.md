Set just off the town square, [[Ulfmyr Village]]’s sole inn welcomes weary travelers day and night. A lonely caravansary long before Ulfmyr Village grew into a village, the inn still retains hints of its rough origins: arrow slits are set into the shutters, a heavy iron bar stands ready to bar the door, and crenellations are set along the roof’s edge.

The ground floor is host to a common room where food and drink are served. A great wolf-spear rests above the bar—a replica of Ulfheonar’s legendary spear. Though the spear appears real, casual inspection reveals that the blade is merely wood, painted blue-silver. The bar is usually tended by Broegan “Bull” Haverson and his daughter Morgan—the town’s latest offering to the hound. If the PCs managed to stop Morgan’s sacrifice, they receive the undying gratitude of Broegan and need not pay for room or board for as long as they stay. However, if the PCs were unable or unwilling to save the girl, the once-cordial giant is lost in his grief.

The second floor of the inn is reserved for private guest rooms, and a small, third floor, for Broegan’s family. However, since the start of the attacks, Broegan has taken to sleeping on the ground floor to better defend his guests should the hound attack.

The defensibility of the Wolf-Spear is not lost on the people of Ulfmyr Village, and many have taken to spending their evenings at the inn, sleeping in the common room. On any given night there are 2d12 locals passing the night with modest dice games and drink, doing their best to forget about the beast prowling outside their doors.

Most nights Lloré, Ulfmyr Village’s sole bard and storyteller, can be found entertaining the crowd. The young, charismatic bard aspires to become an adventurer, but his secret love for Morgan keeps him returning to the Wolf-Spear night after night. Lloré knows nearly every rumor and legend surrounding the hound and is delighted to share them with a fresh audience.
