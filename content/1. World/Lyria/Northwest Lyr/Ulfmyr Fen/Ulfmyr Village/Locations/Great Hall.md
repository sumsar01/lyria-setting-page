# `=this.file.name`
Standing high atop the rocky crag overlooking [[Ulfmyr Village]], the great hall known as Meadhold is the seat of the Jarl’s power. The great hall is built from enormous timbers, thatched with golden straw, and hung with the trophies celebrating the Jarl’s victories. The rampant wolf, the Jarl’s symbol, adorns the hall.
## Overview
The Jarl, his thegns, and Sylle Ru make their home in the hall, sleeping in the common room, weapons close at hand. The Jarl knows that it is only a matter of time before the hound comes for him. Therefore he personally sees that regular sacrifices are offered up to the hound, buying himself time. Though the Jarl places his hopes in the occult studies of Sylle Ru, he secretly fears that in the end nothing will protect him from the hound’s wrath.

The Jarl’s seven [[Thegn]] are **Ofenloch**, **Kreig**, **Orioc**, **Utherl**, **Haedrick**, **Clohn the Bald**, and **Haelf Halfson**. All are battle tested and loyal to the death. But while the Jarl disdains the PCs, the thegns are happy to meet fellow comrades in arms.

## Treasure
In the isolated village, there is little of value, even in the great hall of the Jarl. A search of the hall (impossible while the Jarl still lives) reveals the following:

• A two-handed sword, set with jewels (worth 50 gp)
• The hides of several bears (worth 15 gp altogether)
• A drinking horn, chased with silver and platinum (worth 30 gp)
• Several casks of fine mead (worth a total of 30 gp)
• Two dozen large gold hoops (worth 5 gp each)
• A hammered silver toque (worth 10 gp)
• 3d100 gp, 5d100 sp, and 2d20 pp
