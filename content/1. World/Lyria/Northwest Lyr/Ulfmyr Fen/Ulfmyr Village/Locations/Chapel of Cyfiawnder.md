The simple chapel is the sole structure in [[Ulfmyr Village]]  built entirely from stone. Designed to serve as both a place of worship and defense, the holy sanctum is among the safest places in Ulfmyr Village, second only to the Jarl’s great hall. Despite this, the chapel stands empty most days.

The cause for this desolation is the chapel’s head priest, Father Beacom. A thin man, with the cruel face of a hawk, the Father believes that the hound is retribution for the village’s sins. He stands in the village square, dawn to dusk, shouting that the world is ending and that the villagers have only themselves to blame. A sinner’s sole salvation, the Father declares, is to forsake the material world for [[Cyfiawnder]].

Father Beacom is served by two acolytes, Brother Aker and Brother Haams. Both have taken vows of silence, and follow the Father as he marches through the streets, whipping themselves as penance for their sins.

The Father has little tolerance of priests of other faiths, but he eagerly welcomes devotees of Cyfiawnder, offering them and their allies sanctuary.

Though Father Beacom is loath to admit it, the chapel holds a secret that can aid the PCs in their battle against the Hound of Ulfmyr Village. The stained glass rose window overlooking the nave of the chapel depicts Cyfiawnder battling a devil-hound with a great warhammer. The head to that same spiked warhammer rests atop the chapel’s altar, hidden by a velvet curtain.

Father Beacom refuses to permit the holy relic to leave the sanctity of the chapel and only the faithful may gaze upon the warhammer. But if the head is hung on a stout shaft and rededicated to the service of Law, it regains its +1 vs. demons/ devils enchantment. When wielded by a cleric of Cyfiawnder, it performs as a +2 warhammer. Additionally, the hammer grants the cleric a +1 bonus to saving throws made against evil effects, evil creatures, un-dead, and demons, and inflicts an extra 3 points of damage against the same.
