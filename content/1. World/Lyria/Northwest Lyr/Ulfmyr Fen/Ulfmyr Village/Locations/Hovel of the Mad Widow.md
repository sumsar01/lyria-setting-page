Huddled in the shadow of the Jarl’s great hall, the home of the Mad Widow Ymae seems a world apart from the rest of [[Ulfmyr Village]]. No one visits the lowly hovel, save young boys testing their courage on moonlit nights. It is regarded as common knowledge that Widow Ymae is a witch, and that she will place a curse upon anyone that dares to cross her.

The truth is that the Widow is indeed a witch, or rather a sorceress. Content with her solitude, the Widow disdains the company of her fellow villagers, preferring to wile away her nights in conversation with things beyond the veil. In all of Ulfmyr Village, the Widow Ymae alone doesn’t live in fear of the hound.

Though she has no patience for fools, the Widow welcomes the PCs into her home, recognizing they are cut from a different cloth than the folk of Ulfmyr Village. But should they betray boorish habits, she is quick to send them on their way.

The interior of the hovel seems oddly larger than its exterior would indicate. A lively fire burns in a fire pit in the center of the floor, and a mottled cat sleeps atop a shelf laden with unrecognizable bits of dried animals. The Widow sits with a spindle and distaff, spinning flames from the fire into golden threads.

If queried about the hound, the Widow shares her secret: hundreds of slender threads pressed into the thatched mud of her hovel. Spun from the hair of the dead, the enchanted threads form a barrier impassable to the hound. The same threads, the Widow shares, can be used to bind the hound so that it may be slain.

The Widow is willing to lend her aid to the PCs on the condition that one PC marries her once the hound is slain. If the PCs acquire the hair of a corpse, she weaves the hair into shackles capable of binding the hound.

If a PC breaks his promise to the crone, the would-be spouse is stricken by the Black Death. Oozing pustules spread across the PC’s body, reducing his Strength, Stamina, and Agility by

1 every day. Once any of the character’s stats reach 0 the PC

dies. Once inflicted, the curse can only be lifted by a divine

power—even the sorceress is unable to reverse the curse.

However, if the PC makes good on his promise, he is treated to

a surprise. The Widow, now young, lovely, and bedecked with

flowers, waits at the door of her hovel, her dead husband at her

side. A devilish form composed of flame and darkness, he jealously bids the PC to be gone. The Widow wistfully kisses the

PC goodbye and presents him with a parting wedding present: a shirt of golden mail, woven from the threads of flame. Fine enough to be worn beneath common clothes (though not armor), the shirt serves as +1 chainmail and grants the PC a +2 bonus to saving throws against cold-based effects.
