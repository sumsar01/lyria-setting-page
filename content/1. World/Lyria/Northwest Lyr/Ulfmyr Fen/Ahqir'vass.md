# `=this.file.name`
The water elemental, known as **Ahqir'vass**, is a being of fluid grace and ancient wisdom. It manifests as a towering, translucent figure composed of swirling, crystal-clear water that shimmers with a faint iridescence. Its form is ever-changing, shifting seamlessly between a humanoid shape and a flowing, serpentine stream, as though it is both a living entity and the spring itself.

Ahqir'vass exudes an aura of calm but commanding presence. Intricate, wave-like patterns ripple across its surface, glowing faintly with a deep aquamarine hue that pulses gently, like a heartbeat. The elementalâ€™s "eyes" are swirling vortexes of water, and its voice resonates like a bubbling brook, carrying both a soothing tone and a sense of authority.

The shamans of [[Vasszthar]] have maintained a pact with Ahqir'vass for generations, offering rituals of respect and small offerings of polished stones, shells, and rare minerals to honor its sovereignty over the spring. In return, Ahqir'vass ensures the water remains pure and flowing, vital to the survival of the [[lizardfolk]] settlement and their aqueduct system. It is said that Ahqir'vass also grants protection, raising misty veils or stirring swamp waters to confuse those who threaten its domain or the outpost it sustains.
