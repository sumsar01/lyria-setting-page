# `=this.file.name`
Perched atop a hill, this small but sturdy **Lizardfolk outpost** guards a vital freshwater spring, its strategic importance amplified by the presence of an aqueduct that supplies water to the nearby settlement of **[[Vasszthar]]**. Constructed 52 years ago, the outpost is in need of some repair but remains inhabited by its original [[Lizardfolk]] builders. The aqueduct, a marvel of engineering crafted from imported marble, stands 26 feet tall and spans a mile, delivering clean water with efficiency and style.

The Lizardfolk outpost is called **Zha’til Voss**, which in their tongue roughly translates to _“Sanctuary of the Sacred Waters.”_

This name reflects the outpost’s dual purpose: both as a sacred site guarding the freshwater spring and as a fortified refuge for the Lizardfolk who live there. The name carries a sense of reverence for the spring and its spiritual significance, while also emphasizing the protective nature of the settlement.

Locals from nearby Vasszthar might simply refer to it as **The Waterpost**, though the Lizardfolk likely bristle at the oversimplified name.

## Overview
### **Geography and Environment**

- **Elevation**: The outpost sits 40 yards above the surrounding landscape, atop a naturally elevated hill. This rise in elevation is the product of millennia of natural erosion and weathering.

- **Geology**: A **marble outcropping** dominates the hilltop, providing the key resource for both the aqueduct and parts of the outpost itself. The gleaming white stone gives the site a striking appearance, particularly in the sunlight.

- **Spring**: At the heart of the outpost lies a freshwater spring, which bubbles up from the rock and serves as the lifeblood of the settlement. Its purity and flow are reliable, making it a coveted resource. The spring is the result of an [[Ahqir'vass]] which the shamans of [[Vasszthar]] has made a deal with for generations.

### **The Lizardfolk Outpost**

**Structure Details:**

- **Type**: Dwelling and watchtower.

- **Age and Condition**: Constructed 52 years ago, the outpost shows signs of wear from the elements and the passage of time. Repairs are needed, particularly on the roof and sections of the walls.

- **Size**: Medium-sized, containing **four rooms**.

**Key Features:**

1. **Central Hall**: The heart of the outpost, where the [[Lizardfolk]] gather, eat, and conduct meetings. A circular pool of water from the spring dominates the center, its surface reflecting the light of small, bioluminescent crystals embedded in the ceiling.

3. **Guard Post**: A narrow room on the northern side, overlooking the aqueduct and providing a clear view of the surrounding area. Slits in the walls serve as defensive arrow loops.

5. **Sleeping Quarters**: Two rooms on the eastern side house the [[Lizardfolk]] inhabitants. They are simple yet practical, with sleeping niches carved into the rock and storage alcoves for personal belongings.

7. **Ritual Chamber**: An unusual feature of the outpost, this chamber is dedicated to [[Lizardfolk]] water spirits. It contains a shrine crafted from polished marble and adorned with offerings of shells, bones, and carved stones. The spring feeds a narrow stream that flows through the room, adding a serene ambience.

### **The Aqueduct**

**Structure Details:**

- **Type**: Infrastructure.

- **Age**: Constructed 35 years ago.

- **Dimensions**: The aqueduct is **26 feet tall**, spans **1 mile**, and is **2 feet wide**, designed to deliver water efficiently over a significant distance.

**Construction and Features:**

- **Material**: Made of polished **marble**, which was quarried from the nearby outcropping. The use of imported materials and precise engineering give the aqueduct a sense of grandeur.

- **Design**: The aqueduct is open to the sky, with water flowing along a smooth channel supported by a series of sturdy stone pillars. Its alignment takes advantage of the natural slope of the land to maintain a steady flow of water to [[Vasszthar]].

- **Condition**: Despite its impressive construction, the aqueduct has weathered over the decades and requires periodic maintenance. Cracks are visible in some sections, and moss grows along its edges.
