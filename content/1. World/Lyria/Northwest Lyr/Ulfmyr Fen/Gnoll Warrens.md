# `=this.file.name`
Beneath the twisted Turnspire lies a fetid network of tunnels that serve as the lair of a savage gnoll pack. The cramped passages are smeared with crude markings, littered with bones, and reek of decay. Six chambers sprawl through the warren, including a gruesome feeding pit, a cluttered loot room filled with stolen goods, and the lair of the pack’s cunning alpha. The gnolls guard their territory fiercely, ambushing intruders and preying on nearby travelers and settlers.

- **Location**: Beneath the Turnspire, hidden behind a curtain of vines on the spire’s rocky base, lies the entrance to a **1-level dungeon**. A narrow, jagged tunnel leads into the depths where six chambers form the lair of a marauding gnoll pack.

- **Occupants**: A pack of **10 gnolls**, savage and territorial, uses the dungeon as their home base for raids on nearby areas. They have amassed stolen goods and livestock in the warren, including several of Gorvin's goats.

## **Layout**

 **Chamber 1**: 
 The Entryway – A narrow, filthy tunnel lined with crude gnoll markings and scattered bones.
 The entrance is trapped with a [[Gas]] trap. The exit into the guardroom is rigged with an [[Alarm]].

 **Chamber 2**: 
 Guardroom – Two gnolls always stand watch here, armed with crude spears and shields.+

 **Chamber 3**: 
 Sleeping Den – A foul-smelling room strewn with ragged bedding and refuse.
 
 **Chamber 4**: 
 Feeding Pit – A gruesome pit where the gnolls throw their prey and scraps.
 
 **Chamber 5**: 
 Loot Room – A cavern filled with stolen goods, including sacks of turnips and terrified goats.
 
 **Chamber 6**: 
 Alpha’s Lair – The gnoll pack leader resides here, commanding his pack with ferocious cunning.
