# `=this.file.name`
Braethorn Plain is a vast stretch of rolling grassland, notable for its striking wild burdock fields that grow in unusually orderly clusters. The fields stretch across several acres, their broad leaves and purplish burs swaying in the wind like a sea of green and violet. While seemingly wild, a closer look reveals that the soil beneath the burdock plants has been carefully treatedâ€”its texture subtly different from the surrounding plains. Despite this evidence of prior cultivation, the field has been mysteriously abandoned for many years, with no explanation surviving in local lore or records.

The burdock fields provide an abundant supply of the plant, valued for its edible roots and medicinal properties. However, the untamed nature of the field means harvesting here can be a challenge; the thorny burs catch on clothing, and the plants have grown thick and tangled in the absence of human maintenance.
