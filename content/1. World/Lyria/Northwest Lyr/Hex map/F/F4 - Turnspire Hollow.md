# `=this.file.name`
Turnspire Hollow is a rugged stretch of forestland bisected by a narrow, well-worn dirt road. The area gets its name from the tall, spindly rock outcrop—shaped like a twisted spire—that rises just beyond the treetops. This isolated region serves as a small, self-sufficient hub of agriculture and livestock rearing, though it harbors a darker secret lurking in the shadow of its natural beauty.

[[Gnoll Warrens]]
## Features

### **The Road**:

- A **hard-packed dirt road**, uneven but serviceable, winds through the thick forest. This road connects Turnspire Hollow to nearby settlements of [[Ulfmyr Village]], serving as the primary artery for travelers, merchants, and local farmers bringing goods to market.

- The surrounding forest is dense with towering oaks, tangled undergrowth, and moss-covered stones. It is both serene and ominous, with the canopy casting the road in dappled shadows.

### **Resources**:

- **Goat Livestock**: Several small goat pens, crafted from split logs, dot the forest clearings near the road. The goats are hardy and well-fed, grazing on the lush grass and shrubbery. Local herders raise them for milk, meat, and trade.

- **Cultivated Turnip Fields**: The forest's edge has been cleared to create small, productive plots of farmland. Turnips grow in neat rows, their rich green leaves standing out against the dark, fertile soil. These fields are tended by the handful of residents who call Turnspire Hollow home.

### **The Resident**:

- A single, hardy farmer named **[[Gorvin Haldrick]]** lives in a small timber cabin near the road. Gorvin is a reclusive figure, nicknamed "Three Turns" because he’s been working the turnip fields for three seasons since arriving. His gruff demeanor hides a wealth of local knowledge and a deep suspicion of outsiders.

- Gorvin cares for his goats and crops alone, rarely leaving his cabin except to barter with passing travelers or merchants. He claims to hear strange noises at night coming from the nearby spire.


### **Signs of Gnolls**
Strange tracks  in the mud, clawed and larger than any wolf or dog. The tracks are very fresh.


## Challenges and Opportunities:

### **Threats**:

- **Gnoll Raids**: The gnolls have grown bolder, stealing livestock and raiding the turnip fields. Gorvin is barely holding them off, and his patience is wearing thin. If left unchecked, they could threaten travelers and nearby settlements.
- **Forest Ambushes**: Gnolls often hide in the dense undergrowth near the road, attacking caravans and lone travelers with surprise tactics.

### **Opportunities**:

- **Resources**: The turnips and goats of Turnspire Hollow are valuable commodities that could sustain adventurers or serve as trade goods. Gorvin is willing to share some of his harvest with those who help eliminate the gnoll threat.
- **Dungeon Loot**: The gnolls have collected an eclectic mix of treasures in their lair, including merchant goods, small trinkets, and possibly more significant artifacts hidden among their hoard.

## Narrative Hooks:

- **Quest for the Spire**: Gorvin hires adventurers to clear out the gnolls and recover his stolen livestock. He promises a modest reward but hints at "something strange" near the Turnspire.
- **Local Rumors**: Merchants whisper of eerie howls in the night and disappearing travelers near the spire, enticing adventurers to investigate.
- **Hidden Secrets**: Legends suggest the Turnspire itself is an ancient marker for something buried deep below, possibly older than the gnoll warren.
