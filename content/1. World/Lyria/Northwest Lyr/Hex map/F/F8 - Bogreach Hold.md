# `=this.file.name`
[[Bogreach Hold]] is a small, isolated settlement located deep within a misty, foreboding swamp. The settlement is centered around an old, foreign-built stone dwelling, its pale blue-gray stone unlike anything found in the surrounding swamp or nearby regions. This strange structure has become home to a group of 16 orcs who are attempting to rebuild their lives and establish a foothold in the region. Though they are not yet thriving, the orcs are industrious, working hard to restore the structure while fortifying their small domain against the swamp’s natural dangers.
