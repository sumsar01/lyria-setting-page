# `=this.file.name`
Ss'kharesh Zuhl **"Cursed Place of Bones"** is a desolate and unsettling area in the midst of the swamp, where the ground becomes drier and the stone beneath the earth juts upward, forming a foundation unlike the surrounding marshlands. The location is marked by an eerie stillness and an aura of malevolence that seems to cling to the air. Seven years ago, a massacre claimed the lives of 73 humanoids, most likely Lizardfolk, whose bodies were left exposed to the elements in grotesque disarray. Despite the passage of time, their remains remain strangely preserved, untouched by scavengers or decay.

These corpses are now arranged in ceremonial patterns as part of a dark ritual conducted by an unknown power. The ground here is unhallowed, radiating a chilling energy that seems to echo with the whispers of the dead. Their spirits linger, bound to this place, and their voices can be faintly heard on the wind, pleading, warning, or cursing those who trespass.

### Tower of Kalzheth:

Within Ss'kharesh Zuhl lies the **Tower of Kalzheth**, a three-chamber dungeon hidden among jagged rocks and the twisted remains of long-dead trees. This tower is the domain of an ambitious necromancer who harnesses the power of the unhallowed dead for their dark experiments. Though the tower is small, its presence is oppressive, with symbols of death and desecration carved into the stone walls. Within, the necromancer conducts profane rites, further empowering the malevolent forces that permeate the area.

### Effects
- [[The dead speak]]: The spirits of the fallen whisper and wail, audible to anyone who dares approach. These spectral voices can convey cryptic warnings, fragmented memories of their violent deaths, or curses to intruders.

- [[The evil permeates]]: Any who linger in Ss'kharesh Zuhl feel a creeping dread, and those of weaker will may experience nightmares, hallucinations, or despair.

- [[The dead persist]]: Some of the fallen have risen as skeletal or spectral guardians, animated by the unhallowed energies of the land. They wander the area, defending it from intruders or following the necromancer's commands.
