# `=this.file.name`
Glasloer Mire is an expansive swamp located in the lowlands, where water collects in deep pools surrounded by slick, treacherous mudflats. The area is dotted with patches of hardy reeds and willow-like trees that twist upward from the muck, their roots grasping at the clay for support. When dry, the mudflats crack into an intricate web of lines, but after rain or during the wet season, the entire region becomes a glistening, slippery expanse, nearly impassable without proper footwear or skill.

Despite the harsh terrain, Glasloer Mire is teeming with life. Ducks and waterfowl are abundant, thriving in the pools and feeding on aquatic plants and insects. During the early mornings, the sound of quacking echoes across the mire, and during migrations, the skies darken with vast flocks of birds descending to rest. Locals often come to the swamp for hunting, as the duck population is a valued source of food and feathers.
