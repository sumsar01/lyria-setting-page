## Description:
Cicero embodies the essence of chaos and change. He is a fusion of the forces represented by the tarot cards: "Knight of Cups," "King of Swords," and "The Tower." These aspects are reflected in his actions and nature:

- **Knight of Cups:** Cicero is a master of manipulation and seduction. He understands people's dreams, desires, and wishes, using this knowledge to twist them to his advantage. He is often seen as a romantic, seductive figure who can bring great inspiration or deep despair.

- **King of Swords:** He also has a warrior's side, sharp as a sword. He is cold, logical, and tactical, always able to analyze and exploit any situation. But this sharpness also drives his destructive urge. His will is law, and those who resist him face only his wrath.

- **The Tower:** Cicero is the force of destruction, tearing down old structures to make way for something new, but never without pain and chaos. He brings collapse and change, often violently and unpredictably. This aspect makes him a god many fear, but also respect for his ability to create something new from the ruins.

## Personality:
Cicero is a complex being. He can be both charming and terrifying, a source of both creative inspiration and destructive chaos. He loves to play games with mortals and gods, manipulating events to create the most chaos. His actions are rarely random, even if they often seem so. He has a deep understanding of the human soul and uses this knowledge to challenge existing orders and laws.

## Worshippers:
His followers are often individuals seeking change or those who have lost everything and seek a new beginning through chaos. Many of his priests are warriors, magicians, or wandering philosophers who wish to break free from society's constraints. They see Cicero as a liberating force that can give them the power to rewrite their own destiny.

## Rituals and Dogmas:
Worship of Cicero often involves destructive rituals where old relics are destroyed to symbolize the need for change. The priests preach that only through destruction can new order arise, and that one must accept chaos as a necessary part of life's cycle. Prophecies and visions also play a significant role, with the priests interpreting dreams and omens as signs of coming upheavals.

## Manifestation:
Cicero often manifests as a figure in armor, bearing both a sword and a goblet, with his face reflected as if in a shattered mirror. When he speaks, his voice sounds like multiple voices speaking in unison, and his presence often brings the collapse of structures around him, whether physical buildings or social norms.

Cicero is not a god to summon lightly. His intervention can just as easily bring unexpected power and renewal as it can lead to inevitable catastrophe.
