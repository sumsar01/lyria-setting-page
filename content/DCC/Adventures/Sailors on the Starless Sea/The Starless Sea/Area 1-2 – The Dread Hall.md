> Wide stone steps descend into a long hall. The walls are decorated with elaborate tile mosaics depicting foul ceremonies to horrific and baleful fiends. The walls are slick with condensation and black algae. The condensation runs in rivulets and collects in a long, brackish pool set in the center of the hall.

Have the PCs make a Luck check; on a **DC 15 result**, a character feels a strange compulsion to inspect the base of the pool, then pick up and carry off a skull once discovered (as described below).

When the cult was young and strong, this chamber was used by acolytes to prepare their minds and souls for the awesome presence of the scions of Chaos. Now the chamber has fallen into disuse, scarcely noticed by the beastmen as they pass freely between the underworld and the sunlit lands above.

Characters inspecting the mosaics discover three distinct scenes, as shown on the player handouts (see inside cover):

• A hooded form standing atop a towering stone on the edge of a vast lake; seven tentacles wave from the water. This mosaic offers a clue as to the means of crossing the sea (area 1-4).

• Two armored figures, holding a single flail, commanding legions of hunched, beast-like warriors. This mosaic depicts the brothers Molan and Felan, prior to their defeat by the armies of Law.

• A low island set in the center of a black lake. A golden pyramid is set atop the island, and a figure armed with a flail is preparing to sacrifice a maiden. This hints to the nature of the chaos lord and the fate of the kidnapped villagers.

A casual inspection of the chamber reveals four nooks concealed in the corners of the hall. Each nook contains a single hooded robe, embroidered with bizarre sigils stitched in silver thread. While the robes are mold-eaten and rotten to the touch, they can still be worn as disguises in dim light. The beastmen retain a subconscious memory of the sacred order of Chaos, and, unless provoked, will not attack anyone wearing a robe. Of course, if a PC wearing a robe does attack a beastman or chaos beast, any pretense is immediately ruined.

The fetid pool set in the center of the chamber is thick with black algae and natural slime. Narrow in relation to its length, the pool is 20 feet deep, and its base is lined with hundreds of skulls.

If a character peers into the pool, a skull rises to the surface, a faint glow emanating from its eye sockets. The skulls are the last remnants of challengers that sought to dethrone the chaos lords and still hold a spark of their former spirit, bearing an unholy hatred for the brothers Felan and Molan.

The skulls can be lifted from the murky water and glow brighter the closer they are brought to area 1-5. Though the skulls and their infernal spirits are not lawful-aligned by any means, their hatred can aid the characters in their battle against the chaos lord (see area 1-5A).

If the PCs are brazen enough to enter the pool and dig through the mounds of skulls, they discover a simple bronze ring, roughly 12 inches in diameter, set into the floor of the pool. Rotating the ring 90 degrees causes the floor of the pool to fall away, taking the brackish water, the skulls, and the unfortunate soul that released the valve along with it. The PC is sucked down a narrow tube, slick with algae, into area 1-3. A character sucked down the tube must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 damage as he crashes into area 1-3. Those descending the tube by normal means can climb down to the pool below without risk.
