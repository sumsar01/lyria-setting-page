> The inky cave is nearly submerged with water, the slick ceiling dripping with black algae. Stalactites hang to the dark water’s surface, obscuring the far side of the cavern. Half-submerged along the banks of the pool, skulls leer at you through empty eye sockets. The chamber is as still as a tomb, save for the slow drip of water and slime from above.

The chamber’s ceiling is a mere 4 feet above the floor and only 2 feet above the water’s surface. The water runs in a trickle out the far side of the chamber, down through the rubble, and finally empties into the underground sea (area 1-4).

The chamber can be discovered by opening the valve in area 1-2 or by inquisitive PCs exploring the rocky slope above area 1-4.

The floor of the pool is covered in a slurry of bones and mineral-heavy silt from above. Lucky searchers (DC 12 Intelligence or a DC 12 Luck check) may discover a plain iron ring set with three small rubies on a finger bone. When held in total darkness, the rubies pulse like faint embers. This seemingly simple ring is actually the band of fire, an arcanist antiquity belonging to the enigmatic wizard Sezrakan. When worn by low-level characters, the band has the following powers:

• The wearer may attempt to cast magic missile thrice per day.

• The wearer may attempt to cast fire resistance twice per day.

• The wearer may attempt to cast scorching ray once per day.

• Finally, when worn by a wizard, the ring grants a +1 bonus to all spell checks. A natural 1 still results in failure and possibly worse.

Non-wizards attempting to harness the powers of the band make spell checks at 1d16 + class level, but do not add their Personality or Intelligence modifiers. Penalties for bulky armor still apply. Wizards using the band of fire make their spell checks per the core rules.

Note that while non-wizards may attempt to use the first three powers, they are also subject to any corruption or misfires resulting from failed spell checks. At the judge’s discretion, the band may grant additional powers to powerful wizards (5th level and above).

This is a powerful magic item. If other adventurers hear of the PCs’ possession of it, they can expect to be challenged.
