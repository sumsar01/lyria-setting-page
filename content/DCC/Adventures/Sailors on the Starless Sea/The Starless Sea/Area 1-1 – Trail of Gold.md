> You pause for an instant on the broad stone steps. The hint of gold glimmers at the edge of your light, several steps below.

Closer inspection reveals the glimmer to be entirely mundane: three gold pieces forgotten on the gray stone step. The coins were dropped by the beastmen transporting the wealth of precious coins from area **1-1A** to 1-5.

The beastmen failed to fully close the vault’s secret door. The entrance to area 1-1A can be found with only a cursory inspection. However, PCs that don’t pause to search miss the entrance to area **1-1A**.

A second concealed passageway stands opposite the the vault, leading to area **B-1**. The narrow crack in the passage wall is readily noticed by attentive PCs.
