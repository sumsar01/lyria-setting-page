PCs reaching the peak of the ziggurat discover a horrifying scene:

> The peak of the temple is dominated by a vast, smoking pit that glows with a hellish light. A mighty beastman hoists an effigy of a fearsome armored figure high into the swirling clouds as the prisoners are hurled screaming, one after another, into the pit. A trio of snarling beastmen upends woven baskets, pouring thousands of coins in after your fellow villagers, producing gouts of hissing smoke and flame! All about you is the thundering cacophony of drums and bestial howls as the bizarre ritual nears its climax!

However the PCs decide to reveal themselves, the beastmen swarm towards the PCs while the shaman and his acolytes do their best to finish the ritual. The beastmen on the ramp do not fight to kill, but rather try to seize the PCs, bear them to the pit, and hurl the characters into the sacrificial flames. A PC is seized on a successful attack and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check or be borne 15 feet up the ramp towards the pit. Adjacent beastmen making successful attacks on the same PC increase the difficulty of the Strength check by +2 per attack. On the PC’s own turn, he can do nothing but attempt to escape the grapple with another Strength check.

Characters carried this way to the pit are hurled into the flames and permitted one final save (Reflex DC 15) to catch hold of the edge of the pit. Anyone failing this check plunges to his death in the magma below.

Unlike their fellows, the shaman and his acolytes understand the gravity of the PCs’ presence and fight to kill. If the PCs reach the peak of the ziggurat, the shaman howls to the darkness above and pitches the chaos lord’s effigy into the pit. This immediately extinguishes the flames and plunges the cavern into darkness. The only light remaining is the hellish glow emanating from the pit.

Characters with a view of the pit see the sacrificial bodies and coins consumed by a pool of unholy magma. The effigy bursts into flame, magically drawing in the flesh and gold-steeped magma. Animated by the spirit of the chaos lord, the glowing effigy emerges from the magma, rapidly cooling into a hardened, blackened form. One round later, the rock crust shatters, revealing the fully-armored body of the chaos lord: a hellish, horned humanoid, with a single, cyclopean eye that blazes with infernal light. Molan emerges from his unholy forge and strides into battle, hammering down foes with his triple-headed spiked flail. The skullfaced chaos lord eagerly fights to the death, madly reveling in the destruction of life.

Any skulls brought from the pool in area 1-2 flare bright with hatred. The skulls can be hurled at the chaos lord (Agility check, DC 10 to hit); the skulls shatter on impact, erupting in flame and causing 1d6+1 damage to the chaos lord. Any immediately-adjacent targets take half damage (Reflex save, DC 12 to avoid taking damage altogether).

**The Destruction of the Chaos Lord**: Upon taking 20 hp of damage, the body of the chaos lord dissolves back into magma, the chaos lord’s spirit unable to sustain its hold on its physical form. The flail and the demon armor fall to the ground, the sole remnants of their fallen master.

If the PCs take up either the flail or the armor within 5 rounds, the magma surges back to life with unholy fury, forming a pillar of flaming brilliance. The magma lashes out at any PC within 10’ (Atk +2 melee; dmg 1d4+3). But even the chaos lord’s hatred cannot sustain this form for long: regardless of whether the PCs deal it damage or not, the pillar collapses back into formlessness on the third round, never to rise again.

This true death of the chaos lord triggers the destruction of his temple and cavern. A low rumble rolls through the cavern, building to a deafening roar. Massive stone slabs peel away from the cavern’s ceiling and fall into the sea. Waves crash up the sides of the ziggurat, even as sizzling magma seeps through the seams in the stone blocks. It should be apparent to the PCs that their time atop the chaos lord’s temple is drawing to a close. The PCs have only 1d6+2 actions to escape to the dragon ship before the western cavern collapses, driving a towering wall of water 30 feet over the top of the ziggurat. The judge should not warn the players about their characters’ impending doom. Rather, the judge should make the roll in secret, describe the cataclysmic acts taking place within the cavern, and ask the players to describe their PCs’ actions. Reaching the ship and climbing aboard requires 2 actions.

When the roaring wave engulfs the ziggurat, those aboard the ship are swept towards area 1-6, and all others perish amid the dark waters. Characters that fail to reach the ship in time can attempt a final DC 17 Luck check to pull themselves aboard.

**Favor from the Gods**: The characters’ patrons look on with favor as the chaos lord is destroyed. Characters worshipping good or lawful deities, or those with supernatural patrons who would be opposed to the reign of Chaos, receive a permanent +1 bonus to Luck when the chaos lord is destroyed.

**Treasure**: A king’s ransom of gold and silver is consumed in the chaos lord’s rite, but not all the wealth is lost; ample coinage remains scattered about the top ziggurat. A PC can sweep up 1d20 gp and 2d20 sp per action.

Finally, there remains the arms and armor of the chaos lord himself. Topped with blackened iron and ringed with spikes, the chaos lord’s spiked flail is a weapon of great power. In addition to being +1 to both hit and damage, once per day the wielder of the spiked flail can wreathe the weapon in flames for 3 rounds, inflicting an additional 1d6 points of damage on a successful strike.

The chaos lord’s armor is plate mail forged of blackened iron. While it has no magical properties, its superior construction grants its wearer a Fortitude save (DC 20) against the effects of critical hits.

Taking up either the spiked flail or the armor requires an action.
