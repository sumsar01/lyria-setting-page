## General Features 
Unless noted otherwise, the dungeon is dark and the air is cool and wet.

Doors are unlocked but swollen with moisture and must be forced open. A door can be forced open in a single round with a DC 15 Strength check. Otherwise, battering down the door takes 1d4+1 rounds, alerting anyone (or anything) lurking beyond.

Judges should note that there is little native light in the underworld. PCs can use the torches found in area H, the glowing skulls from area 1-2, or improvise their own light sources.
