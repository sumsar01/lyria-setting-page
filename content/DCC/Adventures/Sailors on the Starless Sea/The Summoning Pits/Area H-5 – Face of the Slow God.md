> A crude stone block stands amidst a mass of thick vines. Four skeletons, fully entangled in the vines, stand around the stone like grisly marionettes; a fifth is splayed out on the block, in mid-dissection. Each skeleton is a bipedal creature, taller than a man, but with the head of a bull, bear or bird, with bleached bones raised in an unholy caricature of worship.

> Hanging all about the chamber are dozens of fleshy green globes. The floor of the chamber is covered in a thick soup of rotting vines and sap.

The vines are the manifestation of an otherworldly being wholly alien to the races of elf, dwarf and man, but so powerful it can best be termed a god. It perceives time on a glacial scale: years are experienced as brief moments, and whole centuries pass like lazy summer days.

Curious about the notion of worship, the slow god is playacting a sacrifice with the skeletal bodies of 5 beastmen. While motionless to the eyes of PCs, the vine-horrors are slowly acting out a ritual over the course of many eons.

The vine-horrors ignore the PCs (which are scarcely perceptible to the slow god) unless the characters interfere with

the ritual or attempt to take one the fruits (literally the body and blood of their god). Alerted, the horrors turn on the PCs with startling swiftness. The “sacrificial victim” atop the altar knits itself back together, and all 5 of the vine-horrors fight to repulse the PCs.

The fleshy globes hanging from the vines are fruits of the slow god. Characters consuming even a bite fall into a coma lasting 1d4 hours. While unconscious, they bear witness to the experience of the slow god, and upon awakening, the PCs have been transformed (roll 1d5):

Characters eating from the vines a second time fall into a coma – and cannot be awakened by means mundane or magical – for 1d3 years. Those eating from the vines a third time are subsumed into the personality of the plant thing, emerging decades later as agents of the slow god.
