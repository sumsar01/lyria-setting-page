> reveal a yawning hole in the floor. Five gore-spattered chains hang in the pit from spikes anchored in the floor. An intense heat wafts up from below, accompanied by the stench of rot.

The original entrance to the summoning chambers collapsed long ago; now the sole entrance is through the collapsed floor. Three feet across, the lip of the hole is coated with blood, bits of hair and bone. (If any player has been reduced to two or fewer characters, the PCs also discover large wicker baskets here, stuffed with bound 0-level villagers. While bereft of equipment or weapons, the villagers are more than happy to aid their rescuers in their battle against the beastmen and their masters.)

The chains hang down in the darkness below, and vary from 13’ to 23’ in length. Each chain ends in large barbed hooks, on each hook is the corpse of a villager. It is 30’ from the lip of the pit to the floor.

The beastmen use the pits to grow vine horrors. Living victims are lowered into the pit, infected with the vines, and then hauled back out again to be used in defense of the keep.

There are 7 bodies total hanging from the chains, each host to a young vine horror. The horrors cannot climb the chains on their own, but eagerly attack if they are hauled from the pits or if PCs attempt to climb down past the horrors en route to area H-2.

Ending the combat is as simple as releasing the chains from their anchors. If the horrors are dropped from their anchors, their bodies explode upon striking the floor in area H-2.

Combat: If both vine attacks from a single vine horror strike the same victim in one round, they entangle the target, automatically inflicting 1d6 points of crushing and choking damage on the following round. An entangled victim can win free with a DC 10 Strength check.
