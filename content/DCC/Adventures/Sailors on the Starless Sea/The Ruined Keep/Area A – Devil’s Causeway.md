> An old dirt road, now overrun with weeds and sickly vines, rises towards the ruined citadel. A grisly sight bars your way: a pair of bodies, secured to poles by long ropey vines. The wicked vines have wormed their way inside the bodies’ eyes, ears, and mouths. To your horror, you realize the bodies are still moving.



The bodies are vine horrors: corpses animated by the foul vines growing from seeds planted in their chests. The rotting bodies serve both as nutritious hosts for the vines and as seed pods for future vine horrors. The horrors’ true nature becomes apparent when the characters approach. The vines unwind from the posts, freeing the horrors to shamble toward the PCs. Each horror attacks twice per round, flailing with its long, ropey vines. If both vines strike the same victim in one round, they entangle the target, automatically inflicting **1d6 points of crushing and choking damage** on the following round. An entangled victim can win free with a **DC 15 Strength check**.

**Vine Horrors (2)**: Init +2; Atk vine +2 melee (1d4); AC 13; HD 2d10; hp 10 each; MV 20’; Act 2d20; SP entangle (automatic 1d6 damage on next round if both vine attacks land; DC 15 Str check to escape); SV Fort +2, Ref +0, Will +2; AL C. 

On the attack that kills a vine horror, the host corpse splits open, spilling out thousands of small seeds slick with mucus. The seeds become unviable in 12 hours but can move 1 foot per hour until then. If a seed reach a corpse before expiring, the corpse rises as a vine horror in **1d4 days**.

The corpses belonged to Keary and Alban, sons of the village smith. The brothers vanished from the village eleven days ago. The beastmen killed the brothers and seeded their corpses with vine horrors to ward off any investigations from the townsfolk. Keary’s corpse is still carrying a **short sword** and **dagger** (gifts forged by his father), and Alban’s corpse has **5 cp** hidden in its right boot.
