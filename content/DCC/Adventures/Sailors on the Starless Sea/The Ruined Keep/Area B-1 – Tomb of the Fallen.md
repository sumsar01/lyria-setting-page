If the PCs approach from the northwest, read or paraphrase the following:

> You squeeze down through the narrow opening, dropping into the small cave below. The air is choked with chalky dust and the pervasive smell of rot. A single shaft of light cuts through the swirling dust to illuminate an enormous stone door set in a portal.
> 
> The portal is circumscribed in runes. At the center of the door is a large pentagram inscribed within a circle. Both the runes and the pentagram are set with silver and seem to glimmer faintly in the dim light.

If the PCs approach from area 1-1, read or paraphrase the following:

> A strange and foreboding portal bars your way. The portal is circumscribed in runes. At the center of the portal is a large pentagram inscribed within a circle. Both the runes and the pentagram are set with silver and seem to glimmer faintly in the dim light.

Wizards, their apprentices, fortune-tellers and astrologers may attempt to decipher the runes (Intelligence, DC 12). A successful check reveals the following phrases:

> the burning purge, which scours the earth the hardened glamour, stilling life the baleful storm, heedless to supplication the raging tempest, devourer from within banes four I place upon this gate:

Fire, Ice, Storm and Hate

On a failed check, the judge is encouraged to make up a misleading translation.

Though heavy, the stone portal is not locked, and can be opened with a DC 20 Strength check. Forcing the door triggers the first ward: a blast of flame engulfs the door, targeting any within 10 feet (Atk fire ward +0 melee; dmg 1d10). Those scrambling out of the hole (Reflex save, DC 15) take only half damage.

Once the portal is cleared the PCs see the following:

> As the last wisps of flame fade, you can make out a soft crackling sound rustling in the chamber beyond. An icy chill settles over the air and your breath condenses into misty clouds.
> 
> Through the portal you can make out a low funerary bier. A body lies in repose atop the stone. The body was once a warrior of some sort—it wears a suit of thick hide armor and clutches an enormous battle axe to its chest.
> 
> The entire chamber sparkles with a soft, elfin glow.

This chamber is the tomb of the warrior Felan, brother to Molan, and fellow chaos lord. Felan was killed in battle with the forces of good and was entombed here to prevent his corpse’s capture and desecration.

The elfin glow emanates from a hardened sheet of ice that coats the entire chamber. Though there is no light source within the tomb, the ice refracts the sunlight from above, bathing the entire chamber in a soft glow.

As evidenced by the characters’ breath, the chamber is preternaturally cold. The cold and ice pose three threats:

• Characters must make a DC 12 Fortitude save for every round spent within the chamber. Each failed save lowers the PC’s movement by 15 feet as his body succumbs to the cold. Once a PC’s movement drops to zero, he can no longer take any actions.

• The floor is covered in polished, hardened ice. Characters attempting to walk across the ice must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or slip to the ground. Attempting to stand takes 1 round. The ice is slick enough for PCs to slide. A PC can push off the bier (or get a running leap from outside) and slide across the room.

• After 5 rounds within the chamber, the PC takes 1d4 points of cold damage per round.

Felan was an enormous man, nearly seven feet tall and muscled like a bear. His hide armor is of excellent craftsmanship, sewn from the thick hides of basilisks and the fur of polar worms. Felan’s enormous axe is forged of meteoric iron and can only be wielded by a character with a Strength score 16 or better. The terrible weapon inflicts 1d10 damage on a hit and inflicts critical hits on a threat range expanded by 1 (i.e., a natural roll of 19-20 for most characters, or 18-20 for a warrior or dwarf who is already at a 19-20 crit range).

Unfortunately, the corpse and its treasures are all frozen within the ice. A DC 20 Strength check is required to break the axe free of the corpse. (This is particularly grisly, snapping Felan’s icy fingers in the process.) Freeing the corpse and its armor is even more difficult, requiring two subsequent DC 23 Strength checks. Each attempt to free the axe or corpse from the ice takes 1 round.

Heroes escaping the tomb with either the axe or the armor are subject to two last wards: the curse of storm and hate. Judges are encouraged to create their own curse, specific to their home campaign. Following are some sample curses to serve as inspiration:

• The next time the PCs are at sea, their ship is overtaken by a fearsome storm. Just as their ship is torn asunder, the heroes see an image of Felan, silhouetted in the heart of the clouds. To survive the PCs must make it to a jungle island, where ancient reptiles lie in wait.

• The wielder of the Axe of Felan is slowly overcome by his passions. At the judge’s choosing (at least once per adventure) the wielder must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or succumb to a violent rage, mindlessly attacking his foes and savagely pursuing them to the death.

• The next time the PCs are traveling through the wilderness, they are overtaken by towering thunderclouds on an otherwise clear day. Just before the rain starts to fall, the PCs spy the silhouette of Felan in the heart of the roiling black clouds. Then comes the lightning. Each PC that entered the tomb is attacked by a bolt of lightning: Atk lightning bolt +1 missile fire; dmg 2d10.
