> The keep’s massive wall has collapsed here, spilling cyclopean stone blocks down the rocky slope. The blocks are precariously balanced atop one another, like a titan’s game of dice.


It is relatively simple work for the PCs to pick their way up the blocks and enter the keep. Several of the blocks are poised to shift if disturbed.

Cautious PCs that choose to carefully inspect the slope can detect and avoid the dangerous blocks with a **DC 10 Intelligence** check. Dwarves or miners receive a free check (**Intelligence, DC 8**) to notice the same. Dwarves should apply their racial bonus to the check.

Those ascending the slope without noting the danger inevitably trigger a slide. One false step and massive granite blocks tumble down the slope, crushing all in their path. Clouds of choking dust fill the air along with the screams of the dying and the deafening crash of stone against stone.

All PCs on the slope are targets: **Atk avalanche +5 melee; dmg 1d10**. The gear of anyone killed in the slide is destroyed. Once the slide is triggered, the slope is safe.

Triggering the avalanche reveals the entrance to a long forgotten tomb. Characters searching the rubble in the aftermath discover a narrow, rocky shaft descending 14 feet before opening into a small cave at the foot of an enormous, rune-carved portal. This is area **B-1**.
