> The dark, moss-eaten gatehouse towers above you, grim and forbidding. Murder holes, fashioned in the likeness of looming toads, threaten to gout forth flaming oil and tar. Black arrow slits pierce the high stone walls. You can hear the flap of the heretical banner above, hidden from sight by the vinedraped battlements.

The ancient drawbridge has long since fallen away into ruin, leaving only a few rotting planks placed across the ditch. The heavy iron portcullis stands half-raised, the rusty spikes a mere four feet above slots cut into the stone floor.

Two snarling beastmen lurk on the second floor of the gatehouse (accessible only from area H). Cautious PCs pausing to listen will hear animal-like sniffing sounds and the scratch of claws on stone coming from above.

The beastmen wait for the PCs to enter, then drop the portcullis on the last rank (Atk portcullis -5 melee; Dmg 1d6/ round). A hero pinned by the portcullis takes ongoing damage each round until he dies or is freed (DC 23 Str check; alternately, 4 characters lifting together can hoist the portcullis if their combined Str exceeds 40).

After dropping the portcullis, the beastmen toll a great bell. This alerts their brothers to the PCs’ presence. Their work done, the howling beastmen withdraw to area H.

Beastmen (2): Init +1; Atk spear +0 melee (1d6); AC 12; HD 1d8; hp 3 each; MV 30’; Act 1d20; SV Fort +1, Ref +1, Will -1; AL C.
