> Flanked by crumbling stone walls, the moss-covered tower stands proud despite the ravages of time. A tall, rust-bound portal bars the tower’s sole entrance, watched over by a leering demonic gargoyle. Rings of deep arrow slits pierce the thick walls, and overarching battlements loom high above.

Heroes trying the tower door discover it barred from within. Breaking down the door requires a DC 20 Strength check. Alternately, a PC armed with an axe or hammer can destroy the door with 5 minutes of hard labor.

The first PCs into the tower discover a hellish scene:

> The hot stench of rot rolls from the tower, raising bile in the back of your throat. The floor of the wide tower is covered in rotting hides of cattle, sheep and men. A narrow staircase spirals around the tower wall. Dark forms hang from chains spiked through the wall—surely these are your fellow countrymen!
> 
> A pack of snarling beast-men slowly emerges from the shadows, bloody spears clutched in their gnarled hands!

The beastmen lurk within the tower, trying to lure the PCs inside one at a time. An enormous beastman champion— a seven-foot monstrosity with the head of a feral bull— crouches atop the spiral staircase directly above the door, attacking the PCs with surprise from above.

The beastmen fight so long as the champion lives, then do their best to flee the tower into the courtyard. They refuse to surrender but take captives if they are able. Captured PCs are bound in chains and hung upside-down from the arrow slits like their fellow villagers, before being subjected to the soul-warping energies of the Well of Souls, transforming the erstwhile heroes into feral beastmen.

The beastman champion wears a large silver torc hung with bleached skulls. Each skull is branded with a chaos rune. By virtue of the craftsmanship and precious metal, the torc is worth 100 gp, but when donned by a chaotic wizard, the torc grants a +1 bonus to all spell checks. Destroying the torc grants lawful aligned PCs a bonus of +1 XP, while earning them the notice (and perhaps enmity) of the gods of Chaos.

**Beastman Champion**: Init +1; Atk axe +2 melee (1d6+2); AC 12; HD 2d8; hp 8; MV 30’; Act 1d20; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will -1; AL C.

**Beastmen (6)**: Init +1; Atk spear +0 melee (1d6); AC 12; HD 1d8; hp 4 each; MV 30’; Act 1d20; SV Fort +1, Ref +1, Will -1; AL C.

The tower floor and the steps spiraling up the wall are covered in gore-covered furs. Searching the chamber scatters waves of fleas and lice. Worse, there is a 1 in 6 chance that the searcher encounters a rot grub hidden amid the rotting hides. On a successful attack, the grub burrows into the PC’s flesh, working its way toward the heart in 1d4+2 rounds. Digging out the grub requires a DC 15 Agility check, causing 1 hp of damage per attempt. Barbers, surgeons, and other PCs with a medical background receive a +2 bonus to the check. If the grub isn’t removed in time, it burrows into the victim’s heart, resulting in instantaneous death

**Rot Grub**: Init (always last); Atk burrow +0 melee (special); AC 10; hp 1; MV N/A; Act 1d20; SP burrow (causes instant death 1d4+2 rounds after successful attack); SV Fort +0, Ref -4, Will +2; AL N.

Persistent searchers discover a small alcove set in the floor, hidden by piles of rotting hides. The alcove contains loose coins (53 sp, 23 gp, and 2 pp) and an elven short sword set with emeralds (worth 150 gp) wrapped in a simple green cloak. Sewn into the hem of the cloak is a treasure map inked on vellum and leading to the location of the judge’s choosing. Three torches, still flammable despite their age, are set in sconces on the wall.

Finally, if an unlucky player has lost all his PCs in the course of the adventure, the judge can opt to allow the PCs to rescue villagers from their chains on the walls. Nursed back to consciousness, the unfortunate souls offer to join the party, becoming PCs under the players’ control. Regrettably (though perhaps mercifully), freed villagers can recall nothing of their ordeal after their capture. The player should roll up the 0-level PCs per the standard rules. At the judge’s discretion, up to six PCs can be added to the party from the captives hanging in the tower.

If none of the players need replacement PCs, the freed captives are too weak and terrified to do anything other than flee back to their village. Regardless of how many captives are freed, they are but a third of the total villagers kidnapped from the characters’ home.
