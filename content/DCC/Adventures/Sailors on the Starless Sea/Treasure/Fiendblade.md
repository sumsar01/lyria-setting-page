In order to wield the sword, a character must first master the fiend (DC 15 Personality check). Failing the check, a PC must focus all his will on mastering the sword, an exhausting task that reduces the wielder’s Personality score by 1d3 points. If a PC ever fumbles the Personality check, or allows his Personality to drop to 3 or less, the blade possesses the character, working to cause the most chaos and destruction possible. The blade remains in control of its former master until the PC is slain or disarmed.

Characters can recover lost Personality in two ways: Rest (recovering 1 point per day), or by using the blade to inflict chaos and ruin (recovering 1 point of Personality per sentient creature slain, or for each ruinous act committed in the name of chaos). The specific nature of these acts are left to the judge’s determination, but should be suitably severe.

The sword possesses limited telepathy (range 20’) and the judge is encouraged to play out these battles of will. The blade can present a devilish charm, but this facade conceals the absolute, unredeemable desire to inflict cruelty and harm on the living.

The fiend-blade inflicts damage as two-handed sword, capable of striking magical, ethereal and astral creatures. When wielded by a Chaos-aligned PC, the blade erupts with blue-green flames that inflict an extra 1d3 damage to flammable creatures.

Finally, by once again exerting his will, a character can command the following effects. Note that each specific effect requires an additional Personality check or Personality sacrifice. (Example: If a character wanted to increase the blade’s attack bonus to +1 for a battle, and also needed to cast magic shield, he would need to make two DC 20 Personality checks, or sacrifice Personality points twice.)

• **DC 20 Personality check, or 1d5 Personality points**: Increase the blade to +1 to hit and damage for the duration of a single battle; magic shield (1d20 spell check); +3 to one saving throw.

• **DC 25 Personality check, or 2d5 Personality points**: Increase the blade to +3 to hit and damage for the duration of a single battle; magic missile (1d24 spell check); negate a critical hit.

• **DC 30 Personality check, or 3d5 Personality points**: Increase the blade to +5 to hit and damage for the duration of a single battle; dispel magic (1d30 spell check); heal wielder 1d5 hit dice.
