A king’s ransom of gold and silver is consumed in the chaos lord’s rite, but not all the wealth is lost; ample coinage remains scattered about the top ziggurat. A PC can sweep up 1d20 gp and 2d20 sp per action.

Finally, there remains the arms and armor of the chaos lord himself. Topped with blackened iron and ringed with spikes, the chaos lord’s spiked flail is a weapon of great power. In addition to being +1 to both hit and damage, once per day the wielder of the spiked flail can wreathe the weapon in flames for 3 rounds, inflicting an additional 1d6 points of damage on a successful strike.

The chaos lord’s armor is plate mail forged of blackened iron. While it has no magical properties, its superior construction grants its wearer a Fortitude save (DC 20) against the effects of critical hits.

Taking up either the spiked flail or the armor requires an action.
