> As you travel down the passage, the sulfuric odor of rotting eggs assaults your nostrils. The chanting is louder ahead, growing with the stench of rot as you approach. The passage leads to a ledge overlooking an enormous water-filled cavern, so huge that it must extend under all of the caves above. Fat black flies buzz over the noisome waters, and are consumed by flying fungal insect-crustacean creatures, which unceasingly chant paeans to the glory of some dark and alien thing through spiracles in their bodies—these strange chanters continually emerge from the lake, akin to mosquito larvae reaching their adult form. A rippling green glow appears beneath the black and stinking waters, like foxfire given off by a corpse, and the true extent of the cavern becomes visible. It is vast beyond measure, held aloft by thick columns of limpet-encrusted rock. Blind dark tentacles reach from the water, as though sensing your presence. One wraps around a chanter, and it is gone. Ahead, beyond the ledge, is another passage [and if the PCs have explored Area 1-10:]—surely the one which leads to the climbable face of the bore hole, and thus to freedom!

As the PCs cross the ledge, the light grows stronger. A babble of alien voices speaking in idiot tongues comes from the water, as the Corruption Below surges upwards. The Corruption Below is a mass of tentacles, blind alien faces— many the size of giants—gibbering in a thousand languages, and ever-shifting flesh. Although it is dark, green-white phosphorescence glimmers around it like an oily sheen. Even worse, wizards and elves can almost hear secrets in its idiot babbling, keys to understanding the laws of the universe and unlocking arcane might. Lawful and neutral clerics know the sounds are blasphemous; chaotic clerics must succeed on a **DC 10 Will save** or be momentarily entranced.

As the characters pass over the ledge, the Corruption Below makes a blind tentacle attack against the character with the lowest Luck score, and against an entranced cleric. This attack has a **+0 bonus**, and only does 1d3 damage, but the victim must succeed in an **opposed Strength check** vs. +8 or be pulled off the ledge and into the lake below. The Corruption Below will make a tentacle attack against any creature in the lake each round. If these attacks hit, the victim cannot make a check to swim until freed by a successful check, and may begin to drown (see below). Successful tentacle attacks prevent a PC from reaching the surface, but a new attack must be made each round, as the tentacles do not maintain their hold. Climbing to the ledge requires a **DC 10 Strength** or **Climb Sheer Surfaces check**.

The Corruption Below is as large as the lake itself; there is no power possessed by the PCs that can harm it in any way.

The following rules apply to PCs in the lake:

• Swimming PCs must make a **DC 5 Strength check** each round to stay afloat. This is modified by armor. A PC can choose to sink but risks drowning.

• Drowning: A submerged PC without an air source can hold their breath for as many rounds as their Stamina score. If they engage in actions while submerged, this duration is halved. Once this time limit expires, the PC begins drowning and must make a **DC 10 Fortitude save** each round or temporarily lose 1 point of Stamina.

• The save DC increases by 1 each round after the first. A drowning PC can take no actions and must be rescued by another character. When a PC’s Stamina reaches 0, they die. If the PC is rescued, the lost Stamina is restored immediately.

• The base speed of all swimming or submerged characters is halved. That rate is further modified by armor.

• Swimming or submerged PCs suffer a -2 modifier to initiative checks.

• Spells may not normally be cast while submerged. Spells may be attempted while treading water, but the caster suffers a -2 penalty to their spell check when doing so.
