> You have reached the side of the bore hole you found earlier, but here the incline favors you! Far above, you can see daylight while a mere two hundred feet above you, you can see the precariously balanced stone which had offered false hope before. It looks like a relatively easy climb, with many ledges where you can pause, but the corruption in the lake below you surges, forcing a portion of its bulk up the shaft behind you—your only hope lies in speed.

If the PCs reached and explored **Area 1-10**, they will automatically recognize this as the side of the bore hole where the incline can be scaled; otherwise adjust the text accordingly. This is a complicated event, and it is recommended that judges print or photocopy the Final Flight Tracker on page 17 to keep track of where participants are. This is effectively a running fight up an inclined surface, where it is important to both keep moving and to limit the number of foes attacking. There is no chance of falling when attacked on a ledge, but climbing characters must succeed on a **Reflex save** (DC 10 + damage taken) it they are hit. Failure means a fall to the next ledge below them. Because the incline decreases velocity, damage is reduced to 1d4 per 10’ fallen.

PCs must make **Strength or Climb Sheer Surfaces checks** to climb the incline, and penalties for armor apply. A character can choose to move less than their allowed move to stop at a ledge if they so desire. A thief can reduce their movement by 10’ to increase the movement of another adjacent PC by 10’, but must choose to do this before the dice are rolled. A character can forego taking an action to help another with a rope, granting that other PC a +10 bonus to their climb check. The distance moved is otherwise determined by the result of the climb check:

| Climb Check Result | Distance Moved         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1 or less          | Fall to previous ledge |
| 2-5                | No movement            |
| 6-10               | 10’                    |
| 11-15              | 20’                    |
| 16+                | 30’                    |

Fighting and Ledges: A character can choose to fight or climb (not both). If not on a ledge, a character can only use a one-handed weapon, and has a -2 penalty to their attack rolls. Characters on a ledge suffer no such penalties.

**Treasures**: The bore hole has been used by surface-dwellers as a place of sacrifice for centuries. As a result, treasures may be found on any ledge between the starting point and the precarious bridge. PCs on a ledge may choose to collect treasures, using an action die, by rolling 1d20 (modified by Luck):

| 16+       | A unique item. Each can only be found once; treat duplicates as 5d6 gp instead. Roll 1d4: <br><br>1. A jade baton, shaped like a human femur. Creatures struck by the baton take 1d4 damage, and must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d3 minutes. On a natural attack roll of “1”, the baton shatters into dust, which rushes into the lungs of the wielder (Will DC 14 or be paralyzed for 1d3 turns). On the wielder’s death, it may be discovered that their right femur has transformed into a new jade baton.<br><br>2. A fist-sized moonstone, worth 200 gp.<br><br>3. Dryad’s Woe, a +1 Lawful longsword (Int 4), which can communicate through simple urges. This weapon does an additional +1 damage against fey creatures. Its purposes are to enforce the law and to build monuments to great heroes. Wielders who support these purposes discover that they can detect secret doors within 30’ by spending a round in concentration.<br><br>4. A silver tube (worth 15 gp) bearing an aged cleric scroll of binding and wood wyrding. The scroll uses the reader’s normal spell check, and crumbles to dust on any failure. Until that occurs, it may be used any number of times. |
The Precarious Bridge: Players will certainly think of many ways to send this crashing down on their enemies below. The question is, will they wait until the entire surviving party has passed this point? The Final Flight Tracker contains the Reflex save DCs to cling to the walls in an attempt to survive the stone’s passage; failure on this save means death. In some cases, success can still inflict damage. Characters who take damage while climbing must succeed on a Reflex save to avoid falling, just as through struck in combat, and then must also endure the consequences of being on the new level (i.e., a new Reflex save, with the same consequences for success and failure). DCs are also given for flying creatures; chanters in the dark may survive the destruction!

If the PCs do not trigger the bridge’s collapse, the Corruption Below automatically does so when it reaches that level.

Corruption Below Actions: At the end of each round, roll 1d3 to determine what the Corruption Below does:

1. **Surge**: The Corruption Below surges upward (1d4-1)×10’ (minimum of 10’). Any creature the Corruption Below comes into contact with is automatically attacked by a tentacle each round, in addition to any other action the Corruption takes.

2. **Grope**: The Corruption Below makes 1d8 tentacle attacks with a 20’ reach. It only attacks each target once, from the lowest Luck upward until it runs out of attacks. Each attack has a +0 bonus and does 1d3 damage. The victim must succeed on an opposed Strength check vs. +8 or be pulled 10’ toward the Corruption, taking 1d4 points of additional damage from abrasion. Any creature in contact with the Corruption is automatically attacked each round, in addition to whatever other action the Corruption takes.

3. **Spew**: The Corruption Below spews out 1d3 chanters in the dark, which immediately move upward 20’, and are able to act in the next round. There is no limit to the number of chanters the Corruption can create.

**Chanters in the Dark** (varies): Init +0; Atk pincer +2 melee (1d4) or bite +0 melee (1 plus venom); AC 12; HD 1d12; hp 7 each; MV 10’ or fly 20’; Act 1d20; SP infravision 60’, immune to mind-affecting spells, venom (DC 7 Fort save or 1d3 temporary Personality damage), turning vulnerability (can be turned by lawful or neutral clerics); SV Fort +3, Ref +0, Will +0; AL C; Crit M/d6.

When the first PC reaches the Precarious Bridge, the Corruption automatically surges 10’ upward every round, in addition to its other actions.

**Escape**: Once the echoes of falling stone have died, and any surviving chanters in the dark have been dispatched, there is no reason to continue having the PCs make checks to climb out of the bore hole.

At long last, you find yourselves once more standing on the surface of the world, under the light of the sun. Although covered in stone dust and grime, you have escaped. You are far from the place where you embarked on the underground river; how far you cannot say. You are unsure even of the direction the water took you. The horrors you discovered below the earth have not been destroyed, but at least they are trapped. For now. Whether they remain trapped for a century, a millennium, or merely a year you cannot say.
