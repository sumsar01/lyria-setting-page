> A beastman stumbles down the street, blood streaming down his face from the empty sockets where his eyes once were.

This event can take place any number of times, and the affected beastman can be of either gender, or of any age. The other beastmen treat this as unremarkable, often refusing to discuss it at all, turning away from anyone who attempts to do so.
