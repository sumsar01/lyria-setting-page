This event may be used to rescue PCs encountering the devil crabs in **Area 1-1**. Alternatively, the event may occur as the PCs travel from **Area 1-2** to **Area 1-3**. In either case, these beastmen are not immediately hostile, and will attempt to resolve the encounter peacefully, even if the PCs are initially combative. If one or more beastmen are slain, the remainder surrender.

**Beastmen (6)**: Init +1; Atk spear +0 melee (1d6); AC 12; HD 1d8; hp 3 each; MV 30â€™; Act 1d20; SV Fort +1, Ref +1, Will -1; AL C; Crit III/d6

These beastmen were swept down the river generations ago, and now inhabit the prehuman ruin of Quetat. Although they are sustained by the Great Fungal Mound (Area 1-8), they are aware of the devil crabs on the beach, and use them as a dietary supplement. The crabs subsist on detritus swept down the river; the beastmen use shreds of fungus to draw them out, and then spear them from **Area 1-2** using the long spears found there.

Regardless of what happens, their goal will be to bring the PCs to Quetat.
