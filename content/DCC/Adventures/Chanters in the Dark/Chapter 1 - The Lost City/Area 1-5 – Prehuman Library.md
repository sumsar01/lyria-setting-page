> This building is different from the others in the ruined city—larger, and shaped in the form of a tall pentagon The stone is greenish-gray, and seems to have resisted the ages better. There is no door protecting the dark interior, just a simple stone arch ringed with strange sigils.

[[Prehuman Library.webp|Show to Players]]

These sigils form a rune of blocking, requiring a **DC 18 Will save** to pass through the portal. Should the PCs manage to enter, read or paraphrase the following:

Within, the interior walls are a maze of surfaces carved with minute runes. Even in darkness, these runes are clearly visible, effortlessly drawing the eye towards them, and sometimes appearing to shift when you are not looking directly at them. The walls seem to go upward far beyond the height even this tall building should allow, and stars—or something like them—twinkle in the vast upper distance.

This library, created by the Yuzz, gives the judge a narrative method of allowing newly-minted wizards and elves to learn their starting spells. The walls can be climbed with a DC 10 Climb Sheer Surfaces check per 30’ climbed, and there is no limit to how far a PC can climb (though a roll of 5 or less indicates a fall).

Each week of study in the library allows a **DC 15 Intelligence check** to gain spell knowledge related to a random wizard spell (level 1d5-2, minimum 1). This doesn’t mean that the wizard has learned the spell, merely that they have gained the potential to learn it. The judge is encouraged to examine the **tables on pages 315-316** of the DCC RPG rulebook, and consider using the library to lay the seeds of future adventures!
