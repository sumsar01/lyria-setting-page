> Rough handholds carved into the rock allow you to climb the black basalt, away from the stony beach. The ground here is uneven, and the air remains wet with spray as the subterranean river breaks on the rock. A low, narrow passage leads approximately to the east, sloping gently downward away from you.

Three long, flexible spears are lying just inside the tunnel. These have bone tips with backward-pointed hooks, used to catch crabs and bring them up onto the rock. Used as weapons, they inflict only **1d4** damage and require two hands to wield, but can reach the nearer part of the beach from the ledge.
