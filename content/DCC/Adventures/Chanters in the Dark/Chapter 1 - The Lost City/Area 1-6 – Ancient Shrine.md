> Some past traveler has fashioned a makeshift statue of Justicia here: you can make out the crudely formed upright sword of justice etched as though covered with flames and the clear, helmless gaze of Her eternal vigil. Although the shrine seems to be ignored—there is no sign of veneration here, and the dust is thick—it still has an aura of sanctity. At some point long ago, a holy symbol was draped around the statue’s neck, and it still appears to be in good condition: a silver disc with the image of a flaming sword worked upon it in gold

Although described as being dedicated to Justicia, the shrine can be altered to match the needs of the judge. It is here to provide a holy symbol to the party, as well as provide some narrative scope to describe how a cleric gains their 1st level abilities. Chaotic creatures (including beastmen and the Caretaker) will not come within 30’ of the shrine.
