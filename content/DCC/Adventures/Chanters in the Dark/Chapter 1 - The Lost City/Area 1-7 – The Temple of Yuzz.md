[[The Temple of Yuzz.png|Show to Players]]

This is the Temple of Yuzz. Its interior is described in Chapter Two, starting on page 12.

Comprehend languages can translate these runes as: 

> “Great is Yullatet Garz; Greater Still Its Masters, the Magician-Priests of Yuzz. Despair, Ye Who Enter Here.”
