**Rebuilders** despair because their people are dying, and they would like to see new blood renew their folk. To the Rebuilders, the PCs represent potential comradesâ€”new citizens, new mates, new genetic potential. They have no real leaders, and they have no real plans. They encourage the PCs to stay, to give up the hopeless quest to find an escape, to take new mates and add to the gene pool. They live throughout Quetat.
