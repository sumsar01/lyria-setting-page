**Reformers** are led by the shaman Glormug (see Event 3), who appears almost human save her lion-like legs and tail. They seek to change the nature of Quetat, overthrowing the priests of the Temple of Yuzz and the beastmen’s dependence on the Great Fungal Mound. Reformers attempt to subsist primarily on devil crabs and glowworms. They see the PCs as potential saviors—outsiders who can destroy the Caretaker and the priests. They know that the priests are evil, but they do not know what they truly are—the un-dead remnants of the Yuzz. They also know that the priests store their collected eyes, and that they are used to empower their magic, but they do not know how. The spirits of the eyes have reached out to Glormug in dreams, begging for release. The Reformers live mostly in the west of the city.
