The Priests of Yuzz make up a fourth faction, which uses the Religious and the Rebuilders to oppose the Reformers. The priests are not beastmen, nor even alive, but they wear the skins of beastmen as disguises, and cover their eyes with thin gauze to hide the bulbous eyes showing through the holes where their beastman-skinâ€™s eyes once were (see Chapter Two: The Temple of Yuzz for more details).
