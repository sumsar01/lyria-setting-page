### Description
The caster produces gouts of fire from his bare hands to burn his enemies.

---

| Manifestation | Roll 1d4: <br>(1) caster’s hands burst into flames; <br>(2) fires spring from the wizard’s fingertips; <br>(3) caster’s hands turn into roiling, smoking flame; <br>(4) skin blackens and peels away to reveal skeletal hands dripping lava.                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Corruption    | Roll 1d4: <br>(1) hands permanently blackened; <br>(2) bare touch causes paper to ignite 25% of the time; <br>(3) body hair burned away permanently; <br>(4) caster suffers a permanent -2 penalty on spell checks to cold-based magics.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Misfire       | Roll 1d4: <br>(1) flame jets from random appendage, spoiling aim; randomly determine where and in what direction the flame gouts; jet causes 1d3 damage to everything within 15’ range in that direction; <br>(2) caster’s hands ignite causing him 1d3 damage; <br>(3) 1d4 random possessions of the caster catch fire and burn to char; (4) all fire within a 15’ radius of the caster is immediately snuffed out. |
