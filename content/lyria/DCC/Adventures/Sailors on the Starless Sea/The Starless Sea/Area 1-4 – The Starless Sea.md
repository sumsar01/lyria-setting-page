> The wide stone steps run down to the dark-sand beach of a vast underground sea. Far out across the water, you can make out a golden glow through the gloom. An enormous menhir stands at the water’s edge, dark waves lapping at its intricately carved faces.
> 
> Past the towering standing stone, a dragon-prowed longship emerges from the darkness, its hull scrawled with forbidding sigils and runes that glow a sickly green in the dim light. The ship draws to a stop some 50 feet offshore.
> 
> The beat of distant drums and far-off wails of terror mixes with the quiet lapping of the waves.

A quick inspection confirms the beach is churned by hundreds of bestial feet, talons, and hooves. Characters pausing to search carefully also discover a single trail of human footprints—tracks left by their fellow villagers chained together—and 1d6 silver coins.

The Starless Sea presents two puzzles to the characters, one apparent and one hidden. The first: how best to board the enchanted ship. The second: how to avoid the wrath of the chaos leviathan lurking beneath the waves of the wine-dark sea.

The menhir is carved with mesmerizing spirals that are almost impossible to trace. Characters that attempt to trace or decipher the carvings are struck by the overwhelming urge to sacrifice their fellows to the leviathan lurking beneath the waves. The PC must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or attack his nearest fellow with the intent of offering his victim’s still-beating heart to the leviathan. The geased PC can attempt to shrug off the compulsion once per round; having made a successful Will save, the PC cannot be compelled by the menhir again.

A narrow series of steps wind up the surface of the menhir. Those climbing to the peak of the standing stone discover that the top of the stone has been fashioned into a platform. A shallow bowl has been cut into the center of the platform. The bowl is partially filled with hardened wax, and the stub of a red candle sits atop the mounds of wax.

**The Dragon Ship**: Boarding the enchanted ship can be as simple as the PCs swimming out into the sea and clambering aboard the ship. This inevitably draws the wrath of the leviathan: a tentacle slithers after the first swimmer that climbs aboard. See below for details on the battle sure to follow.

Relighting the candle—or lighting a new candle—atop the menhir draws the enchanted ship to shore, allowing characters to board in safety.

Once all the PCs have boarded, the ship sets course for the island temple at the heart of the sea (area 1-5). However, halfway through the journey, the PCs must deal with the leviathan (see below).

The ship can also be drawn to shore by lighting the censer (found in area E).

The dragon ship is equipped with oars and, failing magic, can be rowed to the island (area 1-5).

**Treating with the Leviathan**: Upon discovering the underground sea, the original chaos lords struck a pact with the fell beast, and their contract holds to this day. Crossing the underground sea requires successfully dealing with the leviathan lurking in the watery depths. As soon as the enchanted dragon ship crosses halfway to the island, the leviathan’s tentacles emerge from the black waters. Unless the PCs succeed in placating the leviathan within 5 rounds, two great tentacles wrap about the stern, arresting the ship’s progress across the sea. The following round, the leviathan attacks the fools that would dare to cross its domain without offering the required tribute.

Pressed for time, the PCs are certain to come up with innovative and wild solutions to their dilemma. However the PCs attempt to treat with the leviathan, the judge is encouraged to entertain clever solutions and punish foolish ones. Following are some guidelines and indications to help the judge adjudicate the encounter:

• Burning incense in the censer dedicated to the forces of Chaos (found in area E) stills the great tentacles. The leviathan acknowledges its age-old pact, placing its tentacles at the feet of the summoner, before sliding back beneath the waves.

• Sacrificing one or more creatures to the leviathan (as depicted in area 1-2) appeases the leviathan but sorely offends any gods of Law. Characters taking this route damn themselves to the service of wicked gods, or worse, to the absence of any patron whatsoever. Alternately, PCs sacrificing more than 500 gp worth of goods (pouring them into the waves) can placate the chaos beast without offending the patrons of Law.

• False Sacrifice: PCs may attempt to distract the beast by “chumming” the water with corpses or blood. Depending on the sophistication of the ruse, this can buy the PCs time. In this case, the furious leviathan seizes the boat as it draws within 50 feet of the island-temple’s shore.

• Battle the Leviathan: while battling the chaos beast is certainly direct, it likely ends in the destruction of the party, or at the very least the death of those unlucky enough to come within reach of the beast’s 75-foot-long tentacles. The only hope of those electing to attack the beast lies in a critical hit; otherwise, their doom is nearly certain.

In battle, the leviathan first pulls PCs into the sea, then tears them limb from limb. On a successful attack, the leviathan can opt to forgo inflicting damage and instead loop around the PC’s limbs or waist. The following round, the PC must succeed on a Strength check (DC 20) or be drawn into the dark waters.

Note that the leviathan’s body never surfaces and only tentacles emerge dripping from the water. Characters diving beneath the waves to take the battle directly to the leviathan discover an enormous beast covered by thousands of thickly hooded eyes and slack jaws—the horrified, tortured faces of all its previous victims.

Dealing 66 hp of damage to the leviathan does not slay the mighty creature. Rather, the beast withdraws from the battle, propelling itself deep beneath the waves. Any PCs still caught within its tentacles are permitted one last Strength check (DC 20) to wrest free of the leviathan’s mighty grip. Those that fail are drawn beneath the waves and never seen again—except perhaps as terrified, slack-jawed faces embedded into the leviathan’s gibbering hide.
