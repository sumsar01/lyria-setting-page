> A pentagram, circumscribed by a circle of runes, is carved into the stone floor. Sickly green flames lick and dance within the circle, casting the chamber in a ghoulish light. In the center of the circle floats a greatsword, wreathed in emerald flames.

Here the chaos lords successfully summoned a fiend and bound its hellish spirit to a sword. However, the chaos lords were never able to break the devilâ€™s spirit, and the [[Fiendblade]] has languished here ever since, yearning for slaughter. 

The flames within the circle give off no heat or smoke; more accurately, the intense temperatures and choking fumes are held in check by the circle of runes.

Inanimate objects are incinerated as they cross the circle; rope burns like a fuse, swords melt into slag, poles catch fire and are reduced to crumbling cinders. Even stones shatter, as trace amounts of moisture are heated into steam, causing the stones to explode.

Any living creature crossing the runes (either above or below) is instantly transported inside the circle, and begins to asphyxiate, taking 1d3 points of Stamina damage per round, falling unconscious when his Stamina reaches 3, and dying when his Stamina reaches 0. Lost Stamina is restored immediately if the PC escapes the circle alive.

Once inside the circle, PCs find it impossible to escape via mundane means: living creatures cannot pass the circle and non-living things are incinerated. Magic readily pierces the circle, but PCs trapped without spells or divine aid face certain death. Predictably, the fiend-blade offers an escape.

The flaming, beryl sword contains the spirit of the trapped devil. Mastering the sword requires great force of will (DC 15 Personality check). Failing the check, the PC can also elect to sacrifice 1d3 points of Personality, exerting his will over the sword. A character that successfully masters the sword can take up the flaming brand and strike down the invisible barrier; a total of 3 hp damage shatters the barrier, freeing the PC in an explosive rush of heat and smoke, followed by an influx of oxygen. See sidebar for additional details on the blade and regaining lost Personality.

Characters that attempt to wield the blade before mastering the fiend are engulfed in beryl flames, taking 1d10 points of damage per round.
