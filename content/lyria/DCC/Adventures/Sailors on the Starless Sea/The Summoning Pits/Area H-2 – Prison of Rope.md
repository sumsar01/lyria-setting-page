> The walls and floor of the ledge are threaded with vines – it is impossible to step anywhere without hearing the wet crunch of vines underfoot.

Pools of sticky sap have collected on the floor. The pools are easily avoided, but if the PCs investigate the viscous red fluid, they find it faintly acidic, eating away at the flesh of their fingertips and weakening the soles of the boots. Consumed, the liquid inflicts 1d5 damage before destroying the unfortunate soul’s digestive tract.

The chamber’s exits are obscured by the vines. In order to enter the passageways, or go down the steps, the PCs must squeeze past, or cut their way through the vines. If the vines are cut, a torrent of acidic crimson sap gouts forth; PCs within 5’ of the cut vine take 1d8 damage (DC 10 Ref save to avoid). If, by some obscene spate of ill-luck, multiple vines are cut, the acid-sap rises to a depth of 2’, inflicting damage for every round of contact.

The eastern stairs are built of the same crumbling stone as the walls. Inquisitive dwarves and masons alike quickly note the danger. The stairs collapse when weighted with 300 lbs or more, pitching characters 30’ down into an empty pit below for 3d6 falling damage.

A pair of passageways exit either side of the chamber, and both are obscured by the vines. The exit to the north is lit by a flickering beryl light. The passage to the south appears to be the source of the vines, with the massive stalks filling nearly half the passageway.
