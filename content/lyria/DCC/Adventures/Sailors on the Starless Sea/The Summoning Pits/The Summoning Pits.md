The summoning pits were used by the lords of chaos to bolster their strength in the war against the forces of Good. While they failed in this regard, the

lords were successful in summoning two powerful extra-dimensional beings: a devil, now trapped within a greatsword (see area H-3), and a powerful, alien, plant-like entity – the source of the vine horrors (found in area H-5).

The ruins are warmed by heat generated from the decomposing vines. The air is moist and rich with the smell of rot. The walls and floors of the sub-level are sticky with condensation and PCs are constantly assaulted by drops of sappy water falling from the ceiling.

The remaining magic circle in area H-3 burns with green flames, casting faint ambient light throughout the sub-level. The effect won’t be noticed in area H-1 unless the PCs extinguish all their light sources, but grows brighter as they near the summoning chamber. Standing within area H-3, the PCs can see as well as on a moonlit night, and have no need of torches or lanterns.

Thorny vines can be found in every chamber except H-3. They hang from the ceiling and walls, and spill like rope over the floors. The vines have bored through the ceilings and walls, but astute characters will notice that the vines seem to grow larger as the PCs near their source, area H-5.

The passage of time, combined with the effects of the chaos-rot and creeping vines, has wreaked havoc on the stone making up the sub-level’s floor, walls and ceiling. The weakened stone crumbles in the hand, pulling away from the walls and ceiling like clods of hardened dirt. Scaling the crumbling walls is difficult (DC 17 climb sheer surfaces or Agility check), unless the PCs are willing to climb on the nearly ubiquitous vines (DC 10).
