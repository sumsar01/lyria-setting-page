When held in total darkness, the rubies pulse like faint embers. This seemingly simple ring is actually the band of fire, an arcanist antiquity belonging to the enigmatic wizard Sezrakan. When worn by low-level characters, the band has the following powers:

• The wearer may attempt to cast magic missile thrice per day.

• The wearer may attempt to cast fire resistance twice per day.

• The wearer may attempt to cast scorching ray once per day.

• Finally, when worn by a wizard, the ring grants a +1 bonus to all spell checks. A natural 1 still results in failure and possibly worse.

Non-wizards attempting to harness the powers of the band make spell checks at 1d16 + class level, but do not add their Personality or Intelligence modifiers. Penalties for bulky armor still apply. Wizards using the band of fire make their spell checks per the core rules.

Note that while non-wizards may attempt to use the first three powers, they are also subject to any corruption or misfires resulting from failed spell checks. At the judge’s discretion, the band may grant additional powers to powerful wizards (5th level and above).

This is a powerful magic item. If other adventurers hear of the PCs’ possession of it, they can expect to be challenged.
