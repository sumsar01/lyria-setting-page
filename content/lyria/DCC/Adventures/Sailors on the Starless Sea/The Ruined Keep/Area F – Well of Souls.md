> A barren ridge of black stone rises from the overgrown courtyard. A low stone wall marked with eerie sigils is built atop the crest of the stone, marking a well. A stout block and tackle frame supports a single thick chain that plunges into the inky blackness. A soft moan rises from the well, like a faint cry for help.

Though resembling a normal well, the Well of Souls is far more sinister. For reasons unknown even to the chaos lords, the well opens up into an inter-dimensional nexus, permitting access to the raw stuff of proto-elemental chaos. Before the keep fell to the forces of Law, the well was used to condition living sacrifices. Now the inhabitants of the keep use the well to transform captives into the savage, half-feral beastmen.

Very little good can come from toying with the well, but heroes are nothing if not fools.

Those daring to peer into the depths of the well see a yawning darkness. Depth perception and spatial reality have no relationship within the well; it seems to fall away from the PCs even as they draw closer, forcing any PC that peers into the depths to succeed on a DC 13 Will save or pitch over the lip of the well. Adjacent heroes can attempt DC 15 Reflex saves to catch their falling comrade; otherwise the unfortunate soul plummets down into darkness. The victim never strikes bottom; instead, his mind, body, and soul dissolve into nothingness, lost to the ceaseless winds of Chaos.

A falling PC has one last chance to catch himself—a DC 15 Reflex save to catch the chain, but the damage is already done.

Characters entering the well are subsumed by chaos and emerge from the well forever changed. As the PCs descend, damned souls circle about them, and the links of the chain grow tacky, then soft to the touch, and finally drip away like rivulets from a molten candle. The very being of the PC is flayed, with unpredictable results.

For every round spent within the well, the PC must roll 1d10, plus Luck modifier, on the minor corruption table (see DCC RPG core rulebook), as if he had rolled a 1 on a spell check.

Curiously, the well acts as both a boon and bane to wizards. Arcane spells cast within 50 feet of the well receive a +10 bonus to the caster’s spell check. However, each spell cast automatically incurs a corruption (rolled normally on the minor corruption table). Attempts to invoke lawful patrons within the well’s sphere of influence always fail.
