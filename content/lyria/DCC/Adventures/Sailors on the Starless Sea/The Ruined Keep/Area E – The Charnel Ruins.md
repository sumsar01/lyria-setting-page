> This once-proud edifice has fallen into ruin like the rest of the keep. All that remains of the building are fire-scarred high stone walls and toad-faced gargoyles leering from above. The singed, bronze doors—cast with hundreds of wailing demonic faces—are barred from the outside. The portal is marked with a single word drawn in flaking red paint: REPENT.

When the keep fell to the forces of good, acolytes of the chaos god sought refuge within their chapel. Fearing to tread on unholy ground, the invaders barred the doors from without and set fire to the temple, burning the wicked acolytes alive.

It is a simple matter to open the portals. Heroes removing the great wooden beam can easily draw open the bronze portals by the enormous rings held within the maws of two fiendish demons.

Inside, the PCs discover a horrific scene:

> Six charred skeletons lie about the chapel, some crushed by burnt fallen beams. At the head of the chapel is a fountain depicting a squat, demonic toad. A foul, black ichor seeps from the toad’s broad lips, pooling in the basin seated at the foot of the fountain.

Even though the slaughter took place decades ago, the stench of charred flesh lingers in the air along with the sour scent of freshly burnt incense.

Brave PCs that dare to test the skeletons find that the charred bones are hot to the touch, as if the fire burned only yesterday. Cinders glow red and orange beneath each fallen bone.

A cursory inspection of the frog fountain reveals red gemstone eyes and jeweled fangs within the loathsome maw. All together, the 12 semi-precious stones are worth 150 gp.

The following items lie scattered about the temple and skeletons:

• A golden censer, hanging at the end of a long bronze chain, blackened from the heat. The censer is worth 65 gp and can be used to placate certain agents of Chaos (see below).

• A blackened iron coffer, half-buried in the rubble. The coffer is locked and must be picked (DC 15 pick locks) or smashed open (DC 12 Str). Inside are three cones of incense wrapped in sanctified, unholy cloth stitched with golden signs of Chaos.

• Three scorched chainmail hauberks.

• Three blackened maces and one flail.

Retrieving any of the gear or the gems requires entering the chapel. Those stepping inside the temple immediately hear the crackling of cinders and feel the heat of the blackened earth beneath their feet. Though unsettling, this poses no threat to the heroes. Similarly, the charred skeletons offer no danger.

The same cannot be said, however, of the black ichor dribbling from the fountain’s maw and collecting in the fetid basin. Heroes coming within 10 feet of the basin can feel the heat coming off of the toad-fountain. As the PCs come within 5 feet, the ooze animates and rolls up and out of the basin, attacking the nearest PC.

On the round following a successful pseudopod attack, the tar ooze ignites, inflicting 1d4 points of fire damage and setting fire to the unlucky PC. Putting out the fire requires 1 action and quickness on the part of the hero. (“Stop, drop and roll!” is sufficient, but PCs whose players are unable to succinctly describe how they put out the flaming tar burn for another round.)

The tar ooze can also be placated by swinging the charred censer, filling the fallen chapel with incense smoke. So long as the area is suffused with smoke, the tar ooze sits motionless, unmoving and still. There is sufficient incense in the censer to keep the ooze still for 5 rounds. The 3 cones sealed in the coffer can also burn for up to 5 rounds each.

The censer can also be used to placate the chaos leviathan lurking beneath the waves in area 1-4.
