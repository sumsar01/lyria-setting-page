> Pulling away the dead brambles and matted weeds, you find a long flagstone, half-buried in the muddy ground. Digging away the rotting soil, you discover a sigil carved into the face of the flagstone.

The cache can only be found by PCs explicitly searching the courtyard. The flagstone is actually a capstone concealing a small subterranean cist. The small chamber was intended to conceal treasures in case the keep was abandoned to invaders.

Wizards, their apprentices and scribes can attempt a **DC 12 Intelligence** check to translate the rune. Properly identified, it reads: ‘Til Death Shall Pass. If the check fails, the judge is welcome to make up a misleading translation.

Hoisting the capstone requires prodigious might (**Strength check, DC 30**). Alternately, clever PCs might opt to use the block and tackle from the well to lift the stone. Lifting the capstone reveals a small, coffin-like nook, walled and floored with stone.

A hide-wrapped bundle, roughly 5 feet in length, sits atop a pair of wooden rests. Inside the bundle is:

• A stone idol depicting the chaos god Nimlurun.

• A longsword forged of milky steel sheathed in a jewelencrusted scabbard (worth 75 gp).

• A fur-tufted longbow and a leather quiver containing 25 arrows. Age has ruined the bow: on a roll of a natural 1 or 2, the bow snaps, inflicting 1d2 points of damage to the wielder. This weakness is immediately obvious to any hunter or forester.

• A leather pouch containing a granular green powder and a roll of five cloth bandages. When wine or water is added to the green powder, it forms a poultice that heals 1d4+1 hp of damage. Any healer, herbalist, shaman, or cleric can readily identify the powder, or PCs can discover its purpose through experimentation. There is sufficient powder for 10 applications.

The hide is the fur of a rare spotted mountain leopard and can fetch up to 50 gp if sold to the right buyer.
