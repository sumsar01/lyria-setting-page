## General Features

The keep’s walls rise 30 feet from their rammed earth embankments. The walls and all the fallen stones are covered in a patchwork of moss, sickly vines, and lichen. Rather than simple carved blocks, the keep seems to have been built of enormous standing stones and mighty dolmens. The blocks are fitted together crudely, leaving cracks between the stones for rotting vegetation and pools of water that act as host to the gnats and mosquitoes.

## Approaching the Ruins 

The PCs are free to enter as they see fit. While the most obvious approach takes them up the causeway (**area A**), this is also the most dangerous. Wily characters will be rewarded for their suspicion, though hesitation should never be mistaken for caution. Approaching from the west requires the characters to ascend the rubble (**area B**). Picking their way through the fallen blocks is not difficult, but carries its own risks as noted below. Approaching from northeast brings the PCs directly to the sinkhole (**area G**). Characters attempting to ascend walls face a difficult climb. Each character must succeed on a **DC 15** climb check or pitch from the wall — **falling 20 feet for 2d6 damage** — before tumbling down to the base of the rammed earth mound
