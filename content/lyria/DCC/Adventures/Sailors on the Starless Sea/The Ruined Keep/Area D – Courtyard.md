> The courtyard is overgrown with sickly weeds and thick brambles. A deathly silence hangs in the air, as if even the frogs and insects are afraid to draw attention to themselves. The smell of rotting vegetation is pervasive, and the ground sucks at your boots with every tentative step.

Nearly all of the courtyard’s buildings have fallen into ruin. A single burnt-out shell set against the keep’s east wall is the only remaining structure. Set near the heart of the courtyard is a well, framed with a crude pulley system. To the east is the keep’s sole standing tower.

Heroes pausing to inspect the ground easily discover a muddy trail leading from the gatehouse through the brambles to the south tower (**area H**). The small side trail runs to the well (**area F**).

The muddy prints indicate a wide variety of creatures: human footprints, the tracks of large creatures with only three toes, hawk-like talons, and perhaps even the slithering trail of an enormous snake. While seeming to hint at a variety of monsters, all the tracks belong to mutated beastmen.
