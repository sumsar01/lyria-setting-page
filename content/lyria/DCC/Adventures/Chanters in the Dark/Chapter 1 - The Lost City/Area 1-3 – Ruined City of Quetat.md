> The tunnel opens onto an awesome sight—an enormous cavern whose ceiling at least a hundred feet above you glitters as though with blue stars. Before you spreads an ancient and crumbling stone city, with narrow lanes twisting among stone buildings toward a central amphitheater. A few shuffling forms are visible on the streets, and fewer lights of any type. You can easily hear the dripping of water on stone, piping conversations carried on the airs of flutes, and distantly, what sounds like the hollow chanting of monks coming from below the very rock.

The “blue stars” are actually glowworms which descend from the cavern roof on strings of mucus. These, like the crabs and the fungus in **Area 1-8**, are harvested for food by the beastmen. In the case of the glowworms, beastmen children climb 15’ ladders on the edge of the cavern walls in order to reach the lowest-descending of the worms. The

“wood” used by the beastmen is all fungal in nature, and is created by treating material taken from the Great Fungal Mound in **Area 1-8**.

The closer the characters get to the amphitheater (**Area 1-4**), the louder the chanting sounds. The beastmen of Quetat are a dying race. Each wears a bone flute on a thong around their neck. Most of their communication is through playing these flutes, and their notes can echo a long way through the caverns. Complex answers are given with musical notes; vocal answers are a gruff one or two words, thankfully in a close enough approximation of the Common tongue to be easily understood. Their names are likewise accompanied by complicated musical trills, although they have familiar names which the PCs will be able to understand. Any PC can learn enough of the language to carry on a rough conversation over the course of a week or two. If one of the PCs happens to be a minstrel, the judge may allow that character to learn the language more quickly (and more completely).

One in five beastmen (regardless of gender or age) are blind—this usually means their eye sockets are nothing more than bloody holes. However, 1 in 3 of these blind beastmen instead appear to have their eyes atrophied into small, withered prune-like objects—these eyes are actually regrowing (see **Area 1-8**), but this will not be immediately apparent. Blinded beastmen only suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a -10’ reduction in speed; they are accustomed to periodic blindness.

Although the beastmen are chaotic, few are evil.
