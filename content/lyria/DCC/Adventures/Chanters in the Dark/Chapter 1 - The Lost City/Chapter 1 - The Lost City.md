## THE GREAT CYCLE

Although it will not be immediately obvious to the PCs, the un-dead magician-priests of Yuzz have created a cycle of events in Quetat which increases their power, and the power of the Corruption Below:

1. The Caretaker (see Event 4) collects the eyes of beastmen, calcinates them, and leaves them in the Temple of Yuzz (Area 1-7).

2. The un-dead magician-priests use the calcinated eyes to fuel their occult powers, or sacrifice them to the Corruption Below.

3. Sacrificed eyes are used by the Corruption Below to generate chanters in the dark (Area 1-4), and the soul energy they deliver fuels the Corruption’s growth and awareness. However, without the proper sacrificial rituals, these calcinated eyes can be used to slow the Corruption (see Area 2-4 for details).

4. The Great Fungal Mound (Area 1-8) allows victim’s eyes to regrow. Once the new eyes are fully formed, they can be harvested by the Caretaker, and with them a portion of the victim’s soul. The Great Fungal Mound is also addictive, and slightly narcotic, making it difficult for the trapped beastmen to escape Quetat…or to even try.

## FACTIONS

There are three main factions among the beastmen. To determine which group any given beastman belongs to, roll 1d6:

(1) the **Reformers**, (2-4) the **Rebuilders**, (5-6) the **Religious**.

[[Reformers]]

**[[Rebuilders]]**

**[[The Religious]]**

[[The Priests of Yuzz]]

## FEATURES OF Quetat 

The city’s meandering streets are cluttered with cell-like stone buildings, some of which have fallen into ruin. Much of Quetat lies empty, and beastmen change their domiciles frequently as the mood strikes them. The following information will be useful for PCs exploring the city.

**Cells**: The streets are lined with crumbling stone buildings which must have been ancient when humanity was in its infancy. The first creators left no sign of who they were, although they must have been close to humankind in size and build. Beastmen live here now, although few of the stone chambers appear to be occupied.

These stone buildings are where the beastmen live. Only 1 in 7 cells are currently occupied, as the beastmen are in decline. Most are single rooms, but 10% may have 1d3 additional rooms. An unoccupied cell contains the following:

### 1d12 Cell contents

**1-3** Recently occupied, with a 1 in 6 chance of finding a useful item left behind (roll 1d7): (1) spear, (2) 25’ of rope, (3) stone cooking pot, (4) 1d4 tallow candles, (5) flint & steel, (6) stone jar of edible fungal paste, (7) bundle of fungal “wood”.

**4-5** Recently occupied, as above. The inhabitant(s) has gone to the Great Fungal Mound and will be gone for 1d7 days more, regenerating their eyes; at the end of this time, 1d3 beastmen return. This may include single parents with children, mated pair (with or without offspring), siblings, friends dwelling together, or whatever else the judge decides.

**6-10** Deserted.

**11** Cell is now the lair of a creature that preys upon the beastmen—and the PCs, if it can! (roll 1d3): (1) 1d3 giant fire beetles, (2) a ghoul, (3) a giant lizard. Use the creature statistics from the DCC RPG rulebook.

**12** Discovery! The PCs stumble across one of the following. Each item can be found only once (roll 1d4):

1. An ancient Yuzz clay tablet that contains the spell spider climb. Make an Intelligence check when the spell is cast: (5 or lower) suffer a -2d penalty to the spell check, (6-10) suffer a -1d penalty to the spell check, (11-19) the spell check is made normally, (20+) gain a +1d bonus to the spell check. The tablet crumbles when used.

2. A well-made longsword lost by some adventurer ages ago. Although not magical, it is so well balanced as to give a +1 bonus all attack rolls. Unfortunately, it was not well maintained and only does 1d7 damage.

3. The dried corpse of a chanter in the dark (see Area 1-4). Reformers will point to it as a sign of the evil done by the priests of Yuzz. Other beastmen will pretend not to see it, Rebuilders turning away in fear and disgust, while the Religious refuse to acknowledge anything that contradicts their beliefs about the priests of Yuzz.

4. A tarnished silver ring whose band depicts alternating otters and fish. The wearer gains the ability to breathe water and roll checks to swim using 1d30. However, once a natural “1” is rolled, and each time a “1” is rolled thereafter, the wearer makes swimming checks at a reduced die: 1d24, then 1d20, 1d16, and so on down the dice chain. Once 1d10 is reached, the wearer can no longer breathe water. The ring is cursed; once a character wears it in water it cannot be removed until that character is dead or powerful magic is invoked; a remove curse with a spell check of 34+ is sufficient.


## DESCRIBING BEASTMEN

In order to add individuality to beastmen, the judge may roll 1d10 and 1d5, consulting the following table:

|      |                                                                                                                                                                              |

### QUESTIONING THE BEASTMEN

Here are some common questions PCs might ask the beastmen and their responses:

**Q**: Who are you?

**A**: A complicated series of notes on a bone flute, followed by a guttural name. Roll 1d12 twice to generate random beastman names: (1) Gur, (2) Mog, (3) Zurz, (4) Flam, (5) Pukk, (6) Agog, (7) Urm, (8) Shas, (9) Gurf, (10) Zug, (11) Goth, (12) Durd.

**Q**: Is there a way out? Or is there a way to the surface?

**A**: If asked of a Reformer: “Only through temple.” If asked of a Rebuilder, the PCs are led to **Area 1-9**, with a finger pointed to Area 1-10. “Death. Better to stay. Live here.” If asked of a Religious beastman: “Why would you wish to leave the Path?” (spoken with narrowed eyes and a growl)

**Q**: What are those/this thing?

**A**: If asked about a chanter in the dark, only a Reformer will even acknowledge the question. Reformers speak of the Caretaker with loathing, the Religious with fervor, Rebuilders with fear.

**Q**: What happened to you? (Asked of a beastman whose eyes were removed by the Caretaker.)

**A**: Refusal to answer. The beastman simply ignores the question. If the PCs follow, the beastman will lead them to **Area 1-8**.

### GLOWWORMS

Thieves may be asked to help collect the glowworms from the cavern walls, a task that requires both climbing and delicacy. The worms contain a sour bile which, while not itself dangerous, needs to be milked out of the creature in a manner similar to extracting venom. The ancient metal tools used for this — relics of a time before the beastmen came to Quetat— can serve as thieves’ tools. The would-be worm gatherer must study both quiet and finesse to avoid frightening the creatures into retreat — in essence, this is good practice for thieves’ skills. More importantly, the thief who indulges such a request may discover unexpected allies in their time of need.
