## INTRODUCTION

Chanters in the Dark is a Dungeon Crawl Classics adventure designed for a party of 4-8 1st level characters. The characters find themselves trapped

within a lost city, whose enslaved inhabitants see the PCs as potential saviors, comrades, or sacrifices. Escape is possible, but only for the daring. A good mix of character types is required for success, and a party without a thief might never see the surface world again.

This adventure makes use of both encounter locations and events. Events are listed in the text at the time they are likely to occur, but the judge may alter their timing to better suit game play. The goal of the adventure as written is to culminate in an exciting escape up a narrow bore hole while being pursued by an enemy well beyond the PCs’ abilities to challenge. The players may find a way to avoid this final event; if so, the judge merely needs to determine what the ramifications of not sealing off the cavern complex will be.

Finally, while Sailors on the Starless Sea is probably the most iconic Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG adventure, the ending leaves two lingering questions: Where does the underground river lead, and how should a new judge handle PCs gaining their initial class levels? This adventure can be used to answer those questions. Note, however, that this is just an answer, and not necessarily the answer—if you already have answers of your own, keep using them! The judge is always right! Simply ignore the “Leveling Advice” sidebars throughout the adventure.

The author would also like to acknowledge the brilliant work of Harley Stroh, which inspired this adventure, and the support and advice of Michael Curtis, which made it possible.

## BLINDNESS

PCs will probably have to deal with blindness in this adventure, due to darkness, injury, or both. Blinded characters suffer a -4 penalty to initiative rolls,

attack and damage rolls, saving throws, and spell checks, and are easy to surprise. In addition, a blind character firing a missile weapon is at -8 to hit and any missed shot has a 50% chance of striking a randomly determined ally. They can only move at half speed. Under duress, or when lacking guidance, they move in a random direction. In addition, foes gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against blinded creatures.

A cleric attempting to heal blindness must succeed on a lay on hands check for 4 dice of healing. This requires a spell check of at least 20 for those of the same alignment, a 22 or better for adjacent alignments, and is impossible for characters of opposed alignment. The Great Fungal Mound in Area 1-8 can also restore sight, albeit more slowly. Finally, a PC could use a pair of calcinated eyes from Area 2-4 to replace missing eyeballs, regaining sight almost instantly.

The judge should modify read-aloud text if no PC can see, giving the players only information visible to their characters.

## BACKGROUND

Aeons ago, meteoric fragments from a distant world struck Áereth. Two of these fragments hit with enough force to drive deep holes into the crust. One

of these fragments carried an alien proto-fungus which, landing in a deep pool, began to grow. It subsisted in the darkness for thousands of years, continuing to flourish, before it was discovered by the magician-priests of the reptilian Yuzz. The Yuzz founded the subterranean city of Quetat in caves over the pool of the growing proto-fungus, which they named Yullatet Garz—in their language, the Corruption Below.

The magician-priests encapsulated part of the very soul of their chosen victims within their eyes, which were then ritualistically plucked out and sacrificed to the Corruption Below. As the proto-fungus absorbed the souls sacrificed to it, it developed self-awareness, and a form of alien intelligence. Soon enough, it learned to create splinters of itself around the fragmented souls, to create beings which would provide it with continuous worship, and beings which would provide it with endless sacrifices. Quetat was devastated, the Yuzz driven to near-extinction by the Corruption’s hunger.

For centuries, Quetat housed only the dead. Explorers sometimes found the city, and sometimes left their mark, but always they fell to the creatures of the Corruption Below. Over the centuries, the many fragmented souls which lent sentience to the alien proto-fungus also drove it insane. Eventually, a large tribe of beastmen, fleeing the Chaos Lords who had created them, found Quetat and settled there. In doing so, they awoke the dead magician-priests of the Yuzz. The un-dead magician-priests worked to make Quetat sustainable, imbuing a splinter of the Corruption with the power to regenerate the body, if not the soul, and limiting the creatures which the Corruption Below created to steal the eyes and souls of the beastmen.

The Corruption Below now seethes with potential once more. The un-dead magician-priests of the Yuzz seek to control its power, potentially reviving the glory of their agesgone people. This is the cauldron the PCs find themselves in. There is potentially great wealth—and occult power—to be won, but if the PCs linger too long, they may become victims themselves.

## ADVENTURE HOOKS

This adventure starts with the PCs travelling down an underground river in some kind of boat. This can be a river which plunges under the surface in a karst region, or it can be a watercourse discovered while exploring below ground. In either case, there are a number of ways that judges can tempt their players into hazarding the river. Some, or all, of the following may be used:

• The beastman shaman Glormug seeks to break her people’s bond to the Corruption Below: You see the spectral vision of a woman, her robes unable to hide her leonine legs and tail. “I beg you to come and deliver our folk,” the ghostly woman whispers. “Pity us, for we are victims of a great evil. Great honor, great riches, and arcane might await you in Quetat, where the river will take you.” She points down the river before fading away.

• The calcinated eyes of the Caretaker’s victims retain a sliver of their sentience, and call to characters, especially wizards and elves: You have had the dream again, of eyes in the darkness, with the power to fuel your spells. They call to you from down the river, where they await within a dark temple, to either be recovered or lost forever, depending upon what you do.

• Gods or patrons demand that the un-dead magicianpriests be destroyed: “Sail the wine-dark river to the lost city of Quetat. There you must destroy the dead magician-priests in their temple before they unleash their Corruption upon the world.”

• The Eyes of Yuzz (Area 2-4) can be required for spell knowledge, or as a component for a ritual: “Seek ye the Eyes of Yuzz, which lie in the ruined city of Quetat, down the River of Darkness. They will provide the vision/power that you seek.”

Chanters in the Dark can also be used as a direct continuation of the events in Sailors on the Starless Sea. In this case, the ending scene in that adventure leads directly to the start of this one. Regardless of the hook used, eventually the power of the rushing water is so great that the PCs cannot turn back.
