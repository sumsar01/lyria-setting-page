> An elephant-sized creature emerges out of the shadows, like a pale spot looming from the darkness. Shaped like a puffball mushroom or a giant egg, it strides swiftly forward on dozens of pairs of legs, each ending in a suckered foot. The only other visible feature is a long flexible proboscis about three inches in diameter. It reaches out toward an unresisting beastman and, one after the other, uses the proboscis to pluck out the unfortunate creature’s eyes.

[[The Caretaker.webp|Show to Players]]

Beastmen do not resist the Caretaker. They have an almost reverent, worshipful attitude to the Corruption Below and its servants. The PCs may feel differently, especially when they are inevitably targeted by the creature. That will not happen the first time they see it (unless they interfere), but it will happen the next time.

**Caretaker**: Init +3; Atk proboscis +6 melee (1d3 plus pluck eyeball) or ram +4 melee (2d6); AC 16; HD 10d12; hp 60; MV 30’ or climb 20’; Act 1d20; SP infravision 60’, pluck eyeball (DC 10 Ref save to avoid); SV Fort +6, Ref +3, Will +6; AL C; Crit special.

Whenever the Caretaker hits with a proboscis attack, the victim must succeed on a **DC 10 Reflex save** or lose an eyeball. Characters with one eye take a **-2 penalty** to melee attack rolls and a **-4 penalty** to ranged attacks. Characters that lose both eyes are blinded. Any critical hit with a proboscis attack automatically plucks out an eyeball (no save), rather than making a roll on the critical hit chart. The proboscis can extend to attack characters up to 10’ away, and deals only **1 point of damage per eye** if a victim does not resist.

If the Caretaker is slain, it will take the Corruption Below **1d7 days** to generate a new one.
