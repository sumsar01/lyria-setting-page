> Several beastmen approach you. With gestures, plaintive notes on their bone flutes, and a few low-spoken words, they make it clear that they wish you to accompany them. Their eyes dart in shadows, and even their flutings are softly played, as though they fear discovery.

This event should happen in the western portion of Quetat, where the Reformers are strongest, if at all possible. Five beastmen have been sent by their shaman, Glormug, to bring the PCs to her, if they can.

They will lead the PCs to an unremarkable hut, and urge them to enter. If the PCs do so, read or paraphrase the following:

Within the stone chamber you find a woman seated on a stone— she could be human but for her lion-like legs and tail. She smiles up at you and gestures toward other stones which could serve as crude chairs. “I am Glormug,” she says. “I thank you for coming.”

Glormug seeks the PCs’ aid in destroying the Temple of Yuzz at **Area 1-7**, although there is little she can offer them in return. Use the following pieces of dialogue as a guide:

• “Yes, I speak your language. Our people were once human, many generations ago, until we were changed by the Lords of Chaos. Our ancestors escaped that bondage, and found this place.”

• “We traded one form of bondage for another. Here we are slaves to that great mound which sustains us, and in turn our eyes are harvested and used for evil.”

• “I do not know the true nature of the evil preying upon us, but I feel in my bones that it dwells in the Temple of Yuzz. The eyes that are taken from us dwell there for a time. When I sleep, I can hear them calling out to me.”

• “Too few in this city believe the Temple is our foe, and too many believe it is the road to our salvation. You, as outsiders, have a chance to free us from this curse. I have seen it in my dreams. Whether you shall succeed or not, I cannot say, but you must try!”

• “The only way to escape Quetat with your lives is to pass through the Temple. Do not become enslaved as we are! Help us to gain our freedom, I beg of you!”

• “We have neither gold nor gems. If there is treasure to be gained, it lies within the Temple. Or beyond it.”
