> The steps lead downward into a forty-foot-wide by thirty-foot-deep chamber. Stone shelves built into the far wall are the dominant feature, and they contain a plethora of pearlescent stones the size of grapes. On an upper shelf, you spy a dozen red gems the size of oranges. Before them stands a beastman holding a stone knife, his eyes bound by a strip of gauze.

This magician-priest, Hasth the Eye-Taker, paralyzes opponents who fail to make a successful **DC 10 Will save** on a successful attack. Hasth can use an action die to pluck an eye from a paralyzed creature and consume it, restoring him to full hit points. If Hasth is reduced to 0 hp, his body is consumed by worms, which writhe within his beastman skin.

**Hasth the Eye-Taker**: Init +3; Atk stone dagger +2 melee (1d4 plus paralysis); AC 14; HD 3d12; hp 15; MV 30’; Act 2d20; SP infravision 60’, paralysis (DC 10 Will save avoids), pluck and consume eyes, un-dead traits, death throes (consumed by worms); SV Fort +4, Ref +6, Will +5; AL C; Crit U/d8.

The eyes on the shelves are 57 pairs of calcinated eyes taken from beastmen, and six pairs of eyes of Yuzz, taken from living Yuzz before they perished. Calcinated eyes and eyes of Yuzz have the following properties:

1. When examined, they are clearly eyes.

2. In their current form, calcinated eyes can be sold as gemstones worth 10 gp each while eyes of Yuzz are worth 75 gp each.

3. A pair of calcinated eyes from beastmen can be used to replace missing eyes, but both sockets must be empty. It takes 1d3 rounds for them to grow into place. Once in place, they can draw their owner’s attention according to their personality (see below), shifting focus or gaze to highlight whatever they wish noticed, or away from whatever they wish to avoid. They also grant 60’ infravision.

4. All calcinated eyes have personality and volition, and can communicate with anyone they are in direct contact with. Calcinated eyes from beastmen make others aware of what they can do; eyes of Yuzz hate the PCs, and do not.

5. Wizards and elves can use the calcinated eyes of beastmen for spellburn, granting a +1 bonus per pair of eyes consumed by the spell.

6. Eyes of Yuzz can be destroyed when casting a spell, giving a +4 bonus to the spell check per eye destroyed, to a maximum bonus of +20.

7. Any pair of calcinated eyes thrown into the Corruption Below has a chance of preventing it from acting for 1 round. This is a cumulative 5% per pair of beastman eyes, and 10% per pair of eyes of Yuzz.

8. To determine the personality of beastmen eyes, roll 1d14: (1) hedonistic, (2) avaricious, (3) warlike, (4) friendly, (5) shy, (6) jealous, (7) vengeful, (8) materially aesthetic, (9) cowardly, (10) alert, (11) lazy, (12) enthusiastic reader, (13) honest, (14) rude. Eyes of Yuzz simply hate the PCs and communicate nothing else.
