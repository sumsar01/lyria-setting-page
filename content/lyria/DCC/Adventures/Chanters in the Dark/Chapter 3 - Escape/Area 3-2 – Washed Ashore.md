> An underground river crosses the passage ahead of you. The roaring torrent you can hear echoing from upstream has widened here to a swift but shallow water passing downstream into darkness. Shards of wood from your boat have been caught on the rocks here, and perhaps more! The passage continues beyond. You can hear chanting from both the downstream tunnel and the way forward through the lower tunnel.

Anyone who survives the cataract (**Area 1-1**) washes up here. Significant items, including any that the PCs may have lost in the rushing river at the start of the adventure, may also be found among the stones here; use Luck checks to determine if this is the case. Finally, 3d30 gp can be found scattered throughout the area.

PCs who follow the water course find that it grows narrower, deeper, and faster as they go. Traversing this way requires three **Strength checks** (**DC 5, 10, and 15**), with failure indicating that a character is swept off their feet and taken by the current. A **DC 13 Reflex save** allows the character to catch hold of the wall; failure means that the character drops with the water into **Area 3-4**, suffering 1d6 damage in the process. The same Strength checks must be made in reverse to return to the river crossing if characters so choose.
