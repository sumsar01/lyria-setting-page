> The standing stones rest atop a low, craggy bluff. At the center of the stones is a squat stone block. A trio of ravens stands atop the mossy stone, pecking at trails of gore. Four holes are bored into the stone, and thick coils of rope are looped through the stone to make crude shackles.

The altar stones are the remnants of the druidic tradition once practiced on the high moors. At the behest of the sorcerer Sylle Ru, the people of [[Ulfmyr Village]] have sacrificed one of their own every three nights, in hopes of staving off the hound.

If a sacrifice is not made at least once every three nights, the hound descends into Ulfmyr Village, slaying 1d6+1 citizens before its rage is sated.

The hound appears shortly after dusk. Expecting a nearly defenseless peasant, the beast is easily surprised. However, once ambushed at the stones, the hound cannot be surprised here again. If, after being defeated at the stones, the hound discovers a second ambush, it bypasses the standing stones altogether and unleashes its full fury on the people of Ulfmyr Village.
