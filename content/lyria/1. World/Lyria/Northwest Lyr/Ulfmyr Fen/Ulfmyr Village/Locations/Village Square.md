> The village square is largely deserted, save for few scruffy mongrels that pick their way through the abandoned stalls. A locked strongbox rests atop a short wooden post in the center of the square. A tattered banner displaying a sable wolf rampant hangs forlornly above the strongbox.

Most days, Father Beacom and his two silent acolytes (see area A-4) can be found here, proclaiming to all who will listen (as well as to those who refuse to listen) that the Hound of [[Ulfmyr Village]] heralds the end of days and that doom is upon them.

Every three days the people of Ulfmyr Village gather in the square and

draw lots to determine which of their own will be sacrificed to the hound. The town scribe records each citizen’s name on a strip of vellum, which is dropped through the slot into the strongbox. Blindfolded, the Jarl unlocks the strongbox and draws a slip, which is read by the town scribe and confirmed by the priest Father Beacom.

The strongbox is secured with only a simple lock (DC 10 to pick), but a cry goes up if the citizens witness anyone disturbing the coffer. Opening the strongbox reveals the lottery to be a sham: a second box is concealed within the first. The night before the lottery, the Jarl and Sylle Ru choose who is to be sacrificed and place a false slip within the smaller box to be drawn in the lottery.

If the PCs remain in Ulfmyr Village for more than two days, they are expected to take part in the lottery. The Jarl takes this opportunity to do away with his rivals, ensuring that a PC’s name is drawn. If astute rogues examine the slips (forge document check, DC 10), they suspect that—due to discrepancies in the quality of vellum and ink—the script on the slip was written by someone other than the town scribe. Ink and vellum matching the forged slip can be found in the possession of Sylle Ru.
