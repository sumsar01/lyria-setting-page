Those that cannot afford the Wolf-Spear are forced to settle for the Three Rats, a flophouse of the worst order. Run down and filthy, the rats, lice and other vermin vastly outnumber the paying guests.

The two-story building is also home to an informal gang of thieves and ne’er-do-wells. Led by Master Jenks, the band once numbered eight, but the loss of Kej, Stein, and Ilham to the tomb of the Ulfheonar has curtailed both the gang’s number and their audacity. The remaining members, Oleen the Imp, Catkins, Wee Tocs, and Wolf, pass their days drinking cheap wine and dreaming of heists.

If befriended by a fellow rogue, the thieves can offer directions to the serpent mound, but they know nothing of the plight of their former comrades. Between them, the thieves know every false rumor surrounding the hound. Otherwise the rogues are all too eager to take advantage of wealthy strangers. Though too cowardly to commit outright thievery, the informal mob is not above conning the PCs or trading false rumors for the PCs’ hard-won coin.
