# `=this.file.name`
Champion Zathral Bloodfang is the villageâ€™s fiercest warrior, a living legend among his people. His scales are a dark, earthy hue, and his body is covered in scars from countless battles. Zathral wields a massive, bone-crafted spear, and his presence alone is enough to inspire courage in his allies and fear in his enemies. He is the tribe's first line of defense and a symbol of their martial prowess.
