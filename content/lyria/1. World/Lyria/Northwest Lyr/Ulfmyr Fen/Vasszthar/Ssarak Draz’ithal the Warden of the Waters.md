# `=this.file.name`
Ssarak Draz’ithal is the stern and pragmatic leader of the Lizardfolk outpost guarding the freshwater spring and aqueduct. A seasoned warrior and devout steward of the water spirits, Ssarak sees himself as both a protector of his people and a custodian of the sacred spring. His leadership style blends practicality with spiritual reverence, balancing the physical defense of the outpost with a profound respect for the natural and divine forces that sustain it.

### **Physical Appearance:**

- **Height**: Nearly 7 feet tall, with a long, muscular frame that reflects years of physical labor and combat.

- **Scales**: A deep emerald green mottled with streaks of black, a coloration that blends well with the surrounding environment. His scales glisten faintly when wet, giving him a striking appearance when near the spring.

- **Eyes**: Narrow, piercing golden eyes with vertical pupils, often fixed in an intense, thoughtful gaze.

- **Distinguishing Features**: Ssarak bears a network of scars across his chest and arms, marks of battles fought to defend the spring. He also wears a necklace of polished river stones and carved bones, believed to grant him wisdom from the water spirits.

### **Personality:**

- **Pragmatic and Stern**: Ssarak is not one for frivolity or excessive conversation. He values efficiency and expects the same from those around him.

- **Spiritually Devout**: While not a traditional priest, Ssarak holds the spring and its waters as sacred, often performing small rituals to honor Y’Teithiwer and local water spirits.

- **Protective**: His leadership is defined by his fierce loyalty to his people and their survival. While he values tradition, he is willing to adapt if it ensures the safety of his tribe.

- **Cautious Trust**: Ssarak is naturally suspicious of outsiders, particularly those who show interest in the spring or aqueduct. However, he is willing to form alliances if he sees a mutual benefit.

### **Potential Plot Hooks:**

1. **Water Shortages in Vasszthar**: Tensions rise between the Lizardfolk and the people of Vasszthar as water flow slows due to a blockage or sabotage in the aqueduct. Ssarak seeks aid to identify and address the issue before it leads to conflict.

2. **A Mysterious Ritual**: Ssarak performs a rare and elaborate ritual to honor the water spirits, but it draws the attention of an opportunistic faction seeking to exploit the sacred spring.

3. **Raiders or Invaders**: A group of raiders seeks to claim the spring for themselves, forcing Ssarak to defend the outpost. He might seek the help of outsiders, though reluctantly.

4. **The Outpost’s Hidden Secrets**: An ancient relic or artifact lies hidden beneath the spring, revealed during a natural disaster or excavation. Ssarak is torn between preserving the site’s sanctity and using the artifact to strengthen his tribe.

5. **Negotiations with Outsiders**: Vasszthar’s leaders propose a more permanent partnership, but Ssarak is suspicious of their intentions and must decide whether to trust them or reinforce his people’s isolation.
