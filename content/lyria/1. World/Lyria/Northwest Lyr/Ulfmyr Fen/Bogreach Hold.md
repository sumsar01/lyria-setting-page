# `=this.file.name`
Bogreach Hold is a small, isolated settlement located deep within a misty, foreboding swamp. The settlement is centered around an old, foreign-built stone dwelling, its pale blue-gray stone unlike anything found in the surrounding swamp or nearby regions. This strange structure has become home to a group of 16 orcs who are attempting to rebuild their lives and establish a foothold in the region. Though they are not yet thriving, the orcs are industrious, working hard to restore the structure while fortifying their small domain against the swamp’s natural dangers.

### **The Old Stone House**:

- **Age and Materials**: The dwelling is 146 years old and constructed from a unique, almost luminous stone with an otherworldly sheen. Local historians believe it may have been quarried from a distant land or imbued with magical properties that make it unusually durable against the harsh swamp environment. Despite years of abandonment, it remains in decent condition.

- **Layout**: The house is medium-sized, consisting of three rooms: a central hall used for gatherings and dining, a sleeping chamber shared by the orcs, and a storage room where tools, weapons, and supplies are kept.

- **Defenses**: The house is surrounded by a crude but effective wall of sharpened logs lashed together with swamp vines. This barrier serves as both a defense against intruders and a way to mark the orcs' territory.

### **The Plank Road**:

- A primitive wooden road made by laying logs side by side across the swamp’s treacherous muck. Known as a “plank road,” it connects Bogreach Hold to drier ground farther north. While the road is functional, it is often slick with mud and requires constant maintenance by the orcs. Travelers using the road must tread carefully to avoid slipping or breaking through weak spots.

### **The Orcs of Bogreach Hold**:

- The settlement’s 16 inhabitants are a band of orcs, all adults, led by an orc named **Korzhar Stonefist**. They are warriors and builders, focused on turning Bogreach Hold into a permanent home.

- While they are skilled in combat and survival, they lack experience in farming and construction, leading to slow but steady progress as they adapt to their new environment.

- There are no younglings (whelps) in the settlement, as this group left their original tribe behind to start anew. They dream of expanding their numbers and forming a thriving community but are cautious about whom they allow into their fold.
