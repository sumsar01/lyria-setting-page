# `=this.file.name`
Perched atop a hill, this small but sturdy **Lizardfolk outpost** guards a vital freshwater spring, its strategic importance amplified by the presence of an aqueduct that supplies water to the nearby settlement of **[[Vasszthar]]**. Constructed 52 years ago, the outpost is in need of some repair but remains inhabited by its original [[Lizardfolk]] builders. The aqueduct, a marvel of engineering crafted from imported marble, stands 26 feet tall and spans a mile, delivering clean water with efficiency and style.

The Lizardfolk outpost is called **Zha’til Voss**, which in their tongue roughly translates to _“Sanctuary of the Sacred Waters.”_

This name reflects the outpost’s dual purpose: both as a sacred site guarding the freshwater spring and as a fortified refuge for the Lizardfolk who live there. The name carries a sense of reverence for the spring and its spiritual significance, while also emphasizing the protective nature of the settlement.

Locals from nearby Vasszthar might simply refer to it as **The Waterpost**, though the Lizardfolk likely bristle at the oversimplified name.
