[[Owain Vaughan.webp]]

**Role**: Eldest son and heir to House Vaughan  
**Age**: 28  
**Appearance**: Owain is a mirror of his father in his younger years, with dark hair and vivid green eyes, giving him a sharp, intense look. His build is lean but athletic, reflecting the rigorous training he’s undergone. He dresses in simple, practical clothing, though always in the Vaughan colors, ready to lead in both war and governance.

**Personality**: Owain is **ambitious**, **restless**, and has a hunger for proving himself. He is a natural leader, charismatic and quick-witted, though he sometimes struggles with his impulsive nature. While he admires his father’s diplomacy, Owain is eager to carve his own path and is more inclined toward action than negotiation, sometimes to his detriment.

**Notable Feats**: Despite his young age, Owain has already led successful trade negotiations with nearby regions and played a key role in quelling a recent rebellion among disgruntled mercenaries. He is known for his fearlessness in combat and is well-respected by the family’s soldiers. However, his eagerness to prove himself occasionally leads to tension with his father, who counsels patience and caution.
