The Zassath'Kreen tribe is a proud and ancient community of [[lizardfolk]] who have thrived for generations in the harsh environment of the Ulfmyr Fen. Their name, meaning "Children of the Sacred Waters" in their native tongue, reflects their deep connection to the swamp and its spirits. The tribe is known for its fierce warriors, wise shamans, and skilled hunters, all of whom work together to ensure the survival and prosperity of their people.

The Zassath'Kreen are fiercely territorial and protective of their home, which they see as a sacred place bestowed upon them by their ancestors. They are wary of outsiders but will trade with those who show respect for their customs and the land. Their culture is rich with rituals, storytelling, and a deep respect for the natural world, which they see as teeming with spirits that must be honored and appeased.
