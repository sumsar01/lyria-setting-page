The Totem of the Scaled Guardian is a small, intricately carved figure made from dark wood and adorned with vibrant, iridescent scales from a legendary lizardman warrior. The totem is about six inches tall and depicts a fierce lizardman guardian in a protective stance, clutching a spear in one hand and a shield in the other. The eyes of the totem are set with tiny, glowing emeralds that seem to follow anyone who looks at it.

## Story

The Totem of the Scaled Guardian was crafted by the shaman of the [[Vasszthar]] to honor the spirit of [[Zathrak]], a legendary warrior who protected the tribe from numerous threats. According to the tales, Zathrak's spirit was bound to the totem to continue safeguarding the village even after his death. The totem is not just a symbol of protection but a conduit for Zathrak's enduring vigilance and strength.

## Mechanics

1. **Guardian's Vigilance:**
	- Once per day, the bearer can invoke the spirit of Zathrak to gain the benefit of his warrior's vigilance. For the next hour, the bearer has advantage on all perception checks related to detecting threats, traps, or hidden enemies.
2. **Warrior's Fury:**
    - In a moment of great need, the bearer can call upon Zathrak's fury. Once per week, the totem allows the bearer to make a ferocious attack with their weapon, dealing an additional 2d6 damage. The attack is infused with Zathrak's spirit, and the enemy struck must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or be frightened for 1d4 rounds.
3. **Bound Guardian:** 
    - The totem holds a fragment of Zathrak's spirit, making it a double-edged sword. Whenever the bearer is reduced to 0 HP, the totem shatters, releasing Zathrak's spirit to protect the fallen bearer. Zathrak's spirit manifests as a spectral lizardman warrior that fights on behalf of the bearer for 1d4 rounds (use stats for a ghost with appropriate adjustments). After this time, the spirit vanishes, and the totem is destroyed, losing all its magic.

## Drawback

- **Spirit's Wrath:** The totem demands respect and valor. If the bearer mistreats the totem or shows cowardice in battle, Zathrak's spirit becomes enraged. There is a 25% chance each day that the totem's magic will not only cease to function but will actively work against the bearer. This manifests as a -2 penalty to all saving throws and attack rolls, as well as disadvantage on all ability checks. This curse lasts until the bearer performs a significant act of bravery or atonement to regain the favor of Zathrak's spirit. Additionally, the bearer must make a DC 15 Will save or suffer from haunting nightmares, causing them to gain no benefit from a long rest until the curse is lifted.
