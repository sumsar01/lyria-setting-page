Undead that are created within

the unhallowed ground (whether “naturally” or due to

spells such as animate dead) do so with 1d10 hit points

per HD rather than 1d8. There’s a further 1-2 in 6 chance

that one of the following occurs (roll 1d4):

1. Undead regenerate 1 hp per round while within

the unhallowed area.

2. The first time an undead creature is reduced to 0

hp they instead remain at 1 hp.

3. An undead creature destroyed within an

unhallowed area will reform over a period of 1d6

rounds (1), 1d6 minutes (2-3), 1d6 hours (4-5),

or 1d6 days (6) unless their remains are burned,

blessed by a cleric, or removed from the area.

4. Undead created within the area have an AC that is

1 (1-3), 2 (4-5), or 3 (6) better than normal.
