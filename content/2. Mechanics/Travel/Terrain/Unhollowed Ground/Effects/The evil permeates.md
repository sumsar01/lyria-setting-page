The entire unhallowed area

radiates evil. Spells that detect evil or alignment do

not function due to the aura of Chaos that suffuses

the space, and spells or items that ward or rely on the

identification of alignment also do not function.

Lawful-aligned creatures are uneasy in this place, taking

a â€“1 penalty to surprise rolls, and having difficulty

sleeping. Each night they try to sleep in the area they

make a Save v. Spells; failure indicates they do not sleep

soundly enough to regain hp or spells.
