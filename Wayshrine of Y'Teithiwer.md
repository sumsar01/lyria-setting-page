# Wayshrine of Y'Teithiwer
Tucked away in an unassuming clearing where trade routes once crossed, the **Shrine of [[Y'Teithiwer the Traveler|Y'Teithiwer the Traveler]]** is a testament to both its namesake god and the people who once honored him. Though uninhabited for centuries, the shrine remains remarkably intact, its imported stone and craftsmanship speaking to a time when it served as a beacon for travelers and pilgrims alike.

## Overview
### **Exterior:**

- **Two Buildings**:  
    The shrine consists of two distinct structures, both constructed from pale, weathered stone imported from distant lands.
    
    - **The Main Shrine**: A hexagonal stone building with an open front, supported by carved columns depicting winding roads, footsteps, and lucky symbols. At its apex, a compass rose etched in copper gleams faintly, even after centuries.
    - **The Pilgrims’ Hall**: A rectangular structure adjacent to the main shrine. This was once a resting place for weary travelers, with sturdy wooden beams supporting its high, slanted roof.
- **Setting and Approach**:  
    The shrine is surrounded by wild grasses and bordered by ancient cairns that once served as waymarkers. A cobbled path, now half-buried in soil, leads to the shrine’s entrance. The air around the site feels tranquil, almost protective, as though Y'Teithiwer’s influence still lingers.
    

### **Interior:**

- **Main Shrine Room**:  
    The centerpiece of the shrine is a raised stone altar adorned with carvings of swirling paths and symbols of luck: dice, coins, and stars. Behind the altar, a weathered mural shows Y'Teithiwer as a cloaked figure, carrying a staff and leading a group of travelers through unknown lands.
    
- **Treasure and Offerings**:  
    Hidden within compartments under the altar are treasures left by ancient pilgrims, fitting the random assortment of **treasure types (1-A through 6-F)**. These include coins, lucky trinkets, and perhaps even a magical item associated with travel or fortune.
    
- **Pilgrims’ Hall**:  
    Six rooms within the second building suggest it once housed travelers. Each room is simple but functional, with stone sleeping platforms and alcoves for personal belongings. A common hall at the center contains a long, low table and a hearth, long since extinguished but still showing the remnants of burnt logs.
    

### **Condition and Features**

- **Age**: 785 years old, its age is evident in the softened edges of its carvings and the faint cracks running through its stone, yet it is remarkably intact.
    
- **Materials**: The imported stone resists local erosion, while its craftsmanship ensures its enduring stability.
    
- **Surprises**:
    
    - **Hidden Luck Wards**: The shrine is subtly warded with protective blessings, ensuring it remains undisturbed by vandals or looters. Those who harm the site find themselves plagued with misfortune until they atone.
    - **Echo of the Traveler**: Visitors might sense an otherworldly presence—an echo of Y'Teithiwer—that seems to watch over the site, inspiring those who seek guidance.

### **History and Legacy**

The shrine was once a central hub for travelers, merchants, and pilgrims, serving as a place to rest, give thanks, and seek blessings for safe and prosperous journeys. Over time, as trade routes shifted and nearby settlements fell into ruin, the shrine was abandoned.

Still, the enduring protection of Y'Teithiwer seems to linger. Some claim to have stumbled upon it in times of great need, guided by an unseen force. Today, it remains a quiet monument to the god of travel and luck, a place of mystery and hidden treasures for those brave or fortunate enough to find it.
